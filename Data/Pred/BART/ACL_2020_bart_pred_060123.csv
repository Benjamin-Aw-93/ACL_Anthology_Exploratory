"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Inflecting When There's No Majority: Limitations of Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks as Cognitive Models for German Plurals,"Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do? Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form /-(e)d/ to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995) : that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class -and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like /-s/ can still be productively generalized. To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization.","{'sequence': ""Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do?

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Learning to Understand Child-directed and Adult-directed Speech,"Speech directed to children differs from adultdirected speech in linguistic aspects such as repetition, word choice, and sentence length, as well as in aspects of the speech signal itself, such as prosodic and phonemic variation. Human language acquisition research indicates that child-directed speech helps language learners. This study explores the effect of child-directed speech when learning to extract semantic information from speech directly. We compare the task performance of models trained on adult-directed speech (ADS) and child-directed speech (CDS). We find indications that CDS helps in the initial stages of learning, but eventually, models trained on ADS reach comparable task performance, and generalize better. The results suggest that this is at least partially due to linguistic rather than acoustic properties of the two registers, as we see the same pattern when looking at models trained on acoustically comparable synthetic speech.","{'sequence': 'Speech directed to children differs from adultdirected speech in linguistic aspects such as repetition, word choice, and sentence length, as well as in aspects of the speech signal itself, such as prosodic and phonemic variation.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Latent Categorization of Interview Prompts,"Despite the pervasiveness of clinical depression in modern society, professional help remains highly stigmatized, inaccessible, and expensive. Accurately diagnosing depression is difficult-requiring time-intensive interviews, assessments, and analysis. Hence, automated methods that can assess linguistic patterns in these interviews could help psychiatric professionals make faster, more informed decisions about diagnosis. We propose JLPC, a method that analyzes interview transcripts to identify depression while jointly categorizing interview prompts into latent categories. This latent categorization allows the model to identify high-level conversational contexts that influence patterns of language in depressed individuals. We show that the proposed model not only outperforms competitive baselines, but that its latent prompt categories provide psycholinguistic insights about depression.","{'sequence': 'Despite the pervasiveness of clinical depression in modern society, professional help remains highly stigmatized, inaccessible, and expensive.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Recollection versus Imagination: Exploring Human Memory and Cognition via Neural Language Models,"We investigate the use of NLP as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events. To facilitate this, we collect and release HIPPOCORPUS, a dataset of 7,000 stories about imagined and recalled events. We introduce a measure of narrative flow and use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled events. Additionally, we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. Our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow, compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. In addition, while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory, imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. Finally, our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories (e.g., stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; Bartlett, 1932) . Our findings highlight the potential of using NLP tools to study the traces of human cognition in language.","{'sequence': 'We investigate the use of NLP as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events.

Additionally, we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. Our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow, compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. In addition, while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory, imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. Finally, our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories (e.g., stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; Bartlett, 1932) . Our findings highlight the potential of using NLP tools to study the traces of human cognition in language.', 'labels': ['Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10488608479499817, 0.09377003461122513, 0.07211797684431076, 0.058971356600522995, 0.051934245973825455, 0.051668308675289154, 0.05107695981860161, 0.049640953540802, 0.04618094488978386, 0.045853760093450546, 0.04485423117876053, 0.04373505339026451, 0.03793405741453171, 0.03733552619814873, 0.03335990384221077, 0.030776597559452057, 0.027598567306995392, 0.026341814547777176, 0.023125354200601578, 0.022716853767633438, 0.01888061873614788, 0.017930161207914352, 0.009310689754784107]}",0.10488608479499817,Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,0.027598567306995392
"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",A Systematic Assessment of Syntactic Generalization in Neural Language Models,"While state-of-the-art neural network models continue to achieve lower perplexity scores on language modeling benchmarks, it remains unknown whether optimizing for broad-coverage predictive performance leads to human-like syntactic knowledge.

We present a systematic evaluation of the syntactic knowledge of neural language models, testing 20 combinations of model types and data sizes on a set of 34 English-language syntactic test suites. We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M-40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",What determines the order of adjectives in English? Comparing efficiency-based theories using dependency treebanks,"We take up the scientific question of what determines the preferred order of adjectives in English, in phrases such as big blue box where multiple adjectives modify a following noun. We implement and test four quantitative theories, all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. The four theories we test are subjectivity (Scontras et al., 2017) , information locality (Futrell, 2019), integration cost (Dyer, 2017), and information gain, which we introduce. We evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. We find that subjectivity, information locality, and information gain are all strong predictors, with some evidence for a two-factor account, where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics, and information locality reflects collocational preferences.","{'sequence': 'We take up the scientific question of what determines the preferred order of adjectives in English, in phrases such as big blue box where multiple adjectives modify a following noun.

We evaluate the model by comparing its predictions to gold labels from the Media Bias/Fact Check website, achieving 82.6% accuracy.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Summarization', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.1091022714972496, 0.0849965363740921, 0.0818164199590683, 0.07833513617515564, 0.07091057300567627, 0.0629754438996315, 0.06037658080458641, 0.05278473347425461, 0.04666474089026451, 0.04456452652812004, 0.0396864116191864, 0.03565709665417671, 0.03503953292965889, 0.03472842648625374, 0.027470579370856285, 0.024315066635608673, 0.02202712744474411, 0.022018875926733017, 0.015361164696514606, 0.013901940546929836, 0.013172322884202003, 0.012308618053793907, 0.011785882525146008]}",0.1091022714972496,Resources and Evaluation,0.0849965363740921
Computational Social Science and Social Media,"Simple, Interpretable and Stable Method for Detecting Words with Usage Change across Corpora","The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that differ in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and computational social science. This is commonly approached by training word embeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words whose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods often require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and-as we show in this work-result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We propose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and instead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple, interpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different setups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and profession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English, French and Hebrew).","{'sequence': 'The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that differ in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and computational social science.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Analyzing Political Parody in Social Media,"Parody is a figurative device used to imitate an entity for comedic or critical purposes and represents a widespread phenomenon in social media through many popular parody accounts. In this paper, we present the first computational study of parody. We introduce a new publicly available data set of tweets from real politicians and their corresponding parody accounts. We run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets with an emphasis on robustness by testing on tweets from accounts unseen in training, across different genders and across countries. Our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%. Finally, we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis. Beyond research in linguistics and political communication, accurately and automatically detecting parody is important to improving fact checking for journalists and analytics such as sentiment analysis through filtering out parodical utterances. 1 * Equal contribution. † Work was done while at the University of Sheffield. 1 Data is available here: https://archive.org/de tails/parody data acl20 2 The 'Kapou Opa' column by K.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Dynamic Online Conversation Recommendation,"Trending topics in social media content evolve over time, and it is therefore crucial to understand social media users and their interpersonal communications in a dynamic manner. In this research we study dynamic online conversation recommendation, to help users engage in conversations that satisfy their evolving interests. Different from works in conversation recommendation which assume static user interests, our model captures the temporal aspects of user interests. Moreover, our model can cater for cold start problem where conversations are new and unseen in training. We propose a neural architecture to analyze changes of user interactions and interests over time, whose result is used to predict which discussions the users are likely to enter. We conduct experiments on large-scale collections of Reddit conversations. Results on three subreddits show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models based on static assumption of user interests. We further evaluate performance in cold start, and observe consistently better performance by our model when considering various degrees of sparsity of user's chatting history and conversation contexts. Lastly, our analysis also confirms the change of user interests. This further justify the advantage and efficacy of our model.","{'sequence': ""Trending topics in social media content evolve over time, and it is therefore crucial to understand social media users and their interpersonal communications in a dynamic manner.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Balancing Objectives in Counseling Conversations: Advancing Forwards or Looking Backwards,"Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction. Such choices are particularly salient in the consequential domain of crisis counseling, where a difficulty for counselors is balancing between two key objectives: advancing the conversation towards a resolution, and empathetically addressing the crisis situation. In this work, we develop an unsupervised methodology to quantify how counselors manage this balance. Our main intuition is that if an utterance can only receive a narrow range of appropriate replies, then its likely aim is to advance the conversation forwards, towards a target within that range. Likewise, an utterance that can only appropriately follow a narrow range of possible utterances is likely aimed backwards at addressing a specific situation within that range. By applying this intuition, we can map each utterance to a continuous orientation axis that captures the degree to which it is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards. This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its effectiveness.","{'sequence': ""Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction.

This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its effectiveness."", 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'NLP Applications', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08727099746465683, 0.06786185503005981, 0.06266491860151291, 0.05707945674657822, 0.05586446821689606, 0.05545926094055176, 0.054749179631471634, 0.05469083413481712, 0.0483543686568737, 0.042273398488759995, 0.04077107831835747, 0.039073843508958817, 0.03896303102374077, 0.03886864334344864, 0.038734160363674164, 0.035577915608882904, 0.030886806547641754, 0.030490849167108536, 0.026936683803796768, 0.02451309934258461, 0.024214206263422966, 0.023481221869587898, 0.02121974155306816]}",0.08727099746465683,Speech and Multimodality,0.05707945674657822
Computational Social Science and Social Media,What Was Written vs. Who Read It: News Media Profiling Using Text Analysis and Social Media Context,"Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction. The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online, has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Alternatively, we can profile entire news outlets and look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This approach makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself on Twitter) vs. (ii) who read it (i.e., analyzing the readers of the target medium on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube). We further study (iii)  what was written about the target medium on Wikipedia. The evaluation results show that what was written matters most, and that putting all information sources together yields huge improvements over the current state-of-the-art.","{'sequence': 'Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction.

We find that biases found in word embeddings do, on average, closely mirror survey data across seventeen dimensions of social meaning. However, we also find that biases in embeddings are much more reflective of survey data for some dimensions of meaning (e.g. gender) than others (e.g. race), and that we can be highly confident that embedding-based measures reflect survey data only for the most salient biases.","{'sequence': 'Social biases are encoded in word embeddings.

To tackle the first issue, we propose a multimodal interaction module to obtain both image-aware word representations and word-aware visual representations. To alleviate the visual bias, we further propose to leverage purely text-based entity span detection as an auxiliary module, and design a Unified Multimodal Transformer to guide the final predictions with the entity span predictions.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,DTCA: Decision Tree-based Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Claim Verification,"Recently, many methods discover effective evidence from reliable sources by appropriate neural networks for explainable claim verification, which has been widely recognized. However, in these methods, the discovery process of evidence is nontransparent and unexplained. Simultaneously, the discovered evidence only roughly aims at the interpretability of the whole sequence of claims but insufficient to focus on the false parts of claims. In this paper, we propose a Decision Tree-based Co-Attention model (DTCA) to discover evidence for explainable claim verification. Specifically, we first construct Decision Tree-based Evidence model (DTE) to select comments with high credibility as evidence in a transparent and interpretable way. Then we design Co-attention Self-attention networks (CaSa) to make the selected evidence interact with claims, which is for 1) training DTE to determine the optimal decision thresholds and obtain more powerful evidence; and 2) utilizing the evidence to find the false parts in the claim. Experiments on two public datasets, RumourEval and PHEME, demonstrate that DTCA not only provides explanations for the results of claim verification but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance, boosting the F1-score by 3.11%, 2.41%, respectively. 24 Compute loss L(Θ) using Eq.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Measuring Forecasting Skill from Text,"People vary in their ability to make accurate predictions about the future. Prior studies have shown that some individuals can predict the outcome of future events with consistently better accuracy. This leads to a natural question: what makes some forecasters better than others? In this paper we explore connections between the language people use to describe their predictions and their forecasting skill. Datasets from two different forecasting domains are explored: (1) geopolitical forecasts from Good Judgment Open, an online prediction forum and (2) a corpus of company earnings forecasts made by financial analysts. We present a number of linguistic metrics which are computed over text associated with people's predictions about the future including: uncertainty, readability, and emotion. By studying linguistic factors associated with predictions, we are able to shed some light on the approach taken by skilled forecasters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict forecasting skill using a model that is based solely on language.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,"Stock Embeddings Acquired from News Articles and Price History, and an Application to Portfolio Optimization","Previous works that integrated news articles to better process stock prices used a variety of neural networks to predict price movements. The textual and price information were both encoded in the neural network, and it is therefore difficult to apply this approach in situations other than the original framework of the notoriously hard problem of price prediction. In contrast, this paper presents a method to encode the influence of news articles through a vector representation of stocks called a stock embedding. The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction. As one example application, we show the results of portfolio optimization using Reuters & Bloomberg headlines, producing a capital gain 2.8 times larger than that obtained with a baseline method using only stock price data.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Diverse and Informative Dialogue Generation with Context-Specific Commonsense Knowledge Awareness,"Generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses, which often leads to boring conversations. For alleviating this issue, Recent studies proposed to retrieve and introduce knowledge facts from knowledge graphs. While this paradigm works to a certain extent, it usually retrieves knowledge facts only based on the entity word itself, without considering the specific dialogue context. Thus, the introduction of the context-irrelevant knowledge facts can impact the quality of generations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel commonsense knowledge-aware dialogue generation model, ConKADI. We design a Felicitous Fact mechanism to help the model focus on the knowledge facts that are highly relevant to the context; furthermore, two techniques, Context-Knowledge Fusion and Flexible Mode Fusion are proposed to facilitate the integration of the knowledge in the ConKADI. We collect and build a large-scale Chinese dataset aligned with the commonsense knowledge for dialogue generation. Extensive evaluations over both an open-released English dataset and our Chinese dataset demonstrate that our approach ConKADI outperforms the state-of-the-art approach CCM, in most experiments.","{'sequence': 'Generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses, which often leads to boring conversations.

We collect a large-scale nonconversational corpus from multi sources including forum comments, idioms and book snippets.

In this paper, we propose a conversational word embedding method named PR-Embedding, which utilizes the conversation pairs post, reply 1 to learn word embedding. Different from previous works, PR-Embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply. To catch the information among the pair, we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window, then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot","This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world. XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast humanmachine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of largescale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.","{'sequence': 'This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Speak to your Parser: Interactive Text-to-SQL with Natural Language Feedback,"We study the task of semantic parse correction with natural language feedback. Given a natural language utterance, most semantic parsing systems pose the problem as one-shot translation where the utterance is mapped to a corresponding logical form. In this paper, we investigate a more interactive scenario where humans can further interact with the system by providing free-form natural language feedback to correct the system when it generates an inaccurate interpretation of an initial utterance. We focus on natural language to SQL systems and construct, SPLASH, a dataset of utterances, incorrect SQL interpretations and the corresponding natural language feedback. We compare various reference models for the correction task and show that incorporating such a rich form of feedback can significantly improve the overall semantic parsing accuracy while retaining the flexibility of natural language interaction. While we estimated human correction accuracy is 81.5%, our best model achieves only 25.1%, which leaves a large gap for improvement in future research.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Response-Anticipated Memory for On-Demand Knowledge Integration in Response Generation,"Neural conversation models are known to generate appropriate but non-informative responses in general. A scenario where informativeness can be significantly enhanced is Conversing by Reading (CbR), where conversations take place with respect to a given external document. In previous work, the external document is utilized by (1) creating a contextaware document memory that integrates information from the document and the conversational context, and then (2) generating responses referring to the memory. In this paper, we propose to create the document memory with some anticipated responses in mind. This is achieved using a teacher-student framework. The teacher is given the external document, the context, and the ground-truth response, and learns how to build a response-aware document memory from three sources of information. The student learns to construct a response-anticipated document memory from the first two sources, and the teacher's insight on memory creation.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Semi-Supervised Dialogue Policy Learning via Stochastic Reward Estimation,"Dialogue policy optimization often obtains feedback until task completion in taskoriented dialogue systems. This is insufficient for training intermediate dialogue turns since supervision signals (or rewards) are only provided at the end of dialogues. To address this issue, reward learning has been introduced to learn from state-action pairs of an optimal policy to provide turn-by-turn rewards. This approach requires complete state-action annotations of human-to-human dialogues (i.e., expert demonstrations), which is labor intensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel reward learning approach for semisupervised policy learning. The proposed approach learns a dynamics model as the reward function which models dialogue progress (i.e., state-action sequences) based on expert demonstrations, either with or without annotations. The dynamics model computes rewards by predicting whether the dialogue progress is consistent with expert demonstrations. We further propose to learn action embeddings for a better generalization of the reward function. The proposed approach outperforms competitive policy learning baselines on MultiWOZ, a benchmark multi-domain dataset.","{'sequence': 'Dialogue policy optimization often obtains feedback until task completion in taskoriented dialogue systems.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Guiding Variational Response Generator to Exploit Persona,"Leveraging persona information of users in Neural Response Generators (NRG) to perform personalized conversations has been considered as an attractive and important topic in the research of conversational agents over the past few years.

This paper proposes to adopt the personalityrelated characteristics of human conversations into variational response generators, by designing a specific conditional variational autoencoder based deep model with two new regularization terms employed to the loss function, so as to guide the optimization towards the direction of generating both persona-aware and relevant responses. Besides, to reasonably evaluate the performances of various persona modeling approaches, this paper further presents three direct persona-oriented metrics from different perspectives. The experimental results have shown that our proposed methodology can notably improve the performance of persona-aware response generation, and the metrics are reasonable to evaluate the results.","{'sequence': 'Leveraging persona information of users in Neural Response Generators (NRG) to perform personalized conversations has been considered as an attractive and important topic in the research of conversational agents over the past few years.

The experimental results have shown that our proposed methodology can notably improve the performance of persona-aware response generation, and the metrics are reasonable to evaluate the results.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Question Answering', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07878043502569199, 0.07253430783748627, 0.07113562524318695, 0.06707797944545746, 0.06624390929937363, 0.06402669101953506, 0.0541829988360405, 0.0513797402381897, 0.04633895307779312, 0.04367304593324661, 0.042489711195230484, 0.041822973638772964, 0.04053395241498947, 0.04026840999722481, 0.03570316359400749, 0.03300398215651512, 0.028924059122800827, 0.027491653338074684, 0.027190089225769043, 0.024147896096110344, 0.0192425400018692, 0.013972776010632515, 0.009835252538323402]}",0.07878043502569199,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.07878043502569199
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,The Dialogue Dodecathlon: Open-Domain Knowledge and Image Grounded Conversational Agents,"We introduce dodecaDialogue: a set of 12 tasks that measures if a conversational agent can communicate engagingly with personality and empathy, ask questions, answer questions by utilizing knowledge resources, discuss topics and situations, and perceive and converse about images. By multi-tasking on such a broad large-scale set of data, we hope to both move towards and measure progress in producing a single unified agent that can perceive, reason and converse with humans in an open-domain setting. We show that such multi-tasking improves over a BERT pretrained baseline, largely due to multi-tasking with very large dialogue datasets in a similar domain, and that the multi-tasking in general provides gains to both text and image-based tasks using several metrics in both the finetune and task transfer settings.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Multi-Agent Task-Oriented Dialog Policy Learning with Role-Aware Reward Decomposition,"Many studies have applied reinforcement learning to train a dialog policy and show great promise these years. One common approach is to employ a user simulator to obtain a large number of simulated user experiences for reinforcement learning algorithms. However, modeling a realistic user simulator is challenging. A rule-based simulator requires heavy domain expertise for complex tasks, and a data-driven simulator requires considerable data and it is even unclear how to evaluate a simulator. To avoid explicitly building a user simulator beforehand, we propose Multi-Agent Dialog Policy Learning, which regards both the system and the user as the dialog agents. Two agents interact with each other and are jointly learned simultaneously. The method uses the actorcritic framework to facilitate pretraining and improve scalability. We also propose Hybrid Value Network for the role-aware reward decomposition to integrate role-specific domain knowledge of each agent in task-oriented dialog. Results show that our method can successfully build a system policy and a user policy simultaneously, and two agents can achieve a high task success rate through conversational interaction.","{'sequence': 'Many studies have applied reinforcement learning to train a dialog policy and show great promise these years.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Speaker Sensitive Response Evaluation Model,"Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue response generation is very challenging because there are many appropriate responses for a given context. Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth. One approach to resolve this problem is to consider the similarity of the generated response with the conversational context. In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled conversation corpus. Our approach considers the speakers in defining the different levels of similar context. We use a Twitter conversation corpus that contains many speakers and conversations to test our evaluation model. Experiments show that our model outperforms the other existing evaluation metrics in terms of high correlation with human annotation scores. We also show that our model trained on Twitter can be applied to movie dialogues without any additional training.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Efficient Dialogue State Tracking by Selectively Overwriting Memory,"Recent works in dialogue state tracking (DST)   focus on an open vocabulary-based setting to resolve scalability and generalization issues of the predefined ontology-based approaches. However, they are inefficient in that they predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder. This enhances the effectiveness of training and DST performance. Our SOM-DST (Selectively Overwriting Memory for Dialogue State Tracking) model achieves state-of-theart joint goal accuracy with 51.72% in Mul-tiWOZ 2.0 and 53.01% in MultiWOZ 2.1 in an open vocabulary-based DST setting. In addition, we analyze the accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations and suggest that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance. 1","{'sequence': 'Recent works in dialogue state tracking (DST)   focus on an open vocabulary-based setting to resolve scalability and generalization issues of the predefined ontology-based approaches.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Video-Grounded Dialogues with Pretrained Generation Language Models,"Pre-trained language models have shown remarkable success in improving various downstream NLP tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in textual data and generate natural responses. In this paper, we leverage the power of pre-trained language models for improving video-grounded dialogue, which is very challenging and involves complex features of different dynamics: (1) Video features which can extend across both spatial and temporal dimensions; and (2) Dialogue features which involve semantic dependencies over multiple dialogue turns. We propose a framework by extending GPT-2 models to tackle these challenges by formulating videogrounded dialogue tasks as a sequence-tosequence task, combining both visual and textual representation into a structured sequence, and fine-tuning a large pre-trained GPT-2 network. Our framework allows fine-tuning language models to capture dependencies across multiple modalities over different levels of information: spatio-temporal level in video and token-sentence level in dialogue context. We achieve promising improvement on the Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD) benchmark from DSTC7, which supports a potential direction in this line of research.","{'sequence': 'Pre-trained language models have shown remarkable success in improving various downstream NLP tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in textual data and generate natural responses.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Large Scale Multi-Actor Generative Dialog Modeling,"Non-goal oriented dialog agents (i.e. chatbots) aim to produce varying and engaging conversations with a user; however, they typically exhibit either inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all users. This paper addresses these issues by controlling an agent's persona upon generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the GENERATIVE CONVERSATION CONTROL model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model multi-turn conversations in the actor's persona. We introduce an accompanying data collection procedure to obtain 10.3M conversations from 6 months worth of Reddit comments. We demonstrate that scaling model sizes from 117M to 8.3B parameters yields an improvement from 23.14 to 13.14 perplexity on 1.7M held out Reddit conversations. Increasing model scale yielded similar improvements in human evaluations that measure preference of model samples to the held out target distribution in terms of realism (31% increased to 37% preference), style matching (37% to 42%), grammar and content quality (29% to 42%), and conversation coherency (32% to 40%). We find that conditionally modeling past conversations improves perplexity by 0.47 in automatic evaluations. Through human trials we identify positive trends between conditional modeling and style matching and outline steps to further improve persona control. * First two authors have contributed equally. † Research conducted during an internship at NVIDIA.","{'sequence': ""Non-goal oriented dialog agents (i.e. chatbots) aim to produce varying and engaging conversations with a user; however, they typically exhibit either inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all users.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Beyond User Self-Reported Likert Scale Ratings: A Comparison Model for Automatic Dialog Evaluation,"Open Domain dialog system evaluation is one of the most important challenges in dialog research.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Generating Informative Conversational Response using Recurrent Knowledge-Interaction and Knowledge-Copy,"Knowledge-driven conversation approaches have achieved remarkable research attention recently. However, generating an informative response with multiple relevant knowledge without losing fluency and coherence is still one of the main challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method that uses recurrent knowledge interaction among response decoding steps to incorporate appropriate knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge copy mechanism using a knowledge-aware pointer network to copy words from external knowledge according to knowledge attention distribution. Our joint neural conversation model which integrates recurrent Knowledge-Interaction and knowledge Copy (KIC) performs well on generating informative responses. Experiments demonstrate that our model with fewer parameters yields significant improvements over competitive baselines on two datasets Wizardof-Wikipedia(average Bleu +87%; abs.:0.034) and DuConv(average Bleu +20%; abs.:0.047) with different knowledge formats (textual & structured) and different languages (English & Chinese).","{'sequence': 'Knowledge-driven conversation approaches have achieved remarkable research attention recently.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Gated Convolutional Bidirectional Attention-based Model for Off-topic Spoken Response Detection,"Off-topic spoken response detection, the task aiming at predicting whether a response is offtopic for the corresponding prompt, is important for an automated speaking assessment system.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for offtopic spoken response detection with high offtopic recall on both seen and unseen prompts. We introduce a new model, Gated Convolutional Bidirectional Attention-based Model (GCBiA), which applies bi-attention mechanism and convolutions to extract topic words of prompts and key-phrases of responses, and introduces gated unit and residual connections between major layers to better represent the relevance of responses and prompts.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,CDL: Curriculum Dual Learning for Emotion-Controllable Response Generation,"Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging. Existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization terms to standard cross-entropy loss and thus influence the training process. However, due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency, the common problem of response generation tasks, safe response, is intensified. Besides, query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and response are simply ignored in previous models, which would further hurt the coherence. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework named Curriculum Dual Learning (CDL) which extends the emotion-controllable response generation to a dual task to generate emotional responses and emotional queries alternatively. CDL utilizes two rewards focusing on emotion and content to improve the duality. Additionally, it applies curriculum learning to gradually generate high-quality responses based on the difficulties of expressing various emotions. Experimental results show that CDL significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of coherence, diversity, and relation to emotion factors.","{'sequence': 'Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling,"As an essential task in task-oriented dialog systems, slot filling requires extensive training data in a certain domain. However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem.

Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-theart approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning to Customize Model Structures for Few-shot Dialogue Generation Tasks,"Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems. Existing methods tend to use the meta-learning framework which pre-trains the parameters on all non-target tasks then fine-tunes on the target task. However, fine-tuning distinguishes tasks from the parameter perspective but ignores the model-structure perspective, resulting in similar dialogue models for different tasks. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can customize a unique dialogue model for each task in the few-shot setting. In our approach, each dialogue model consists of a shared module, a gating module, and a private module. The first two modules are shared among all the tasks, while the third one will differentiate into different network structures to better capture the characteristics of the corresponding task. The extensive experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms all the baselines in terms of task consistency, response quality, and diversity.","{'sequence': 'Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"Generate, Delete and Rewrite: A Three-Stage Framework for Improving Persona Consistency of Dialogue Generation","Maintaining a consistent personality in conversations is quite natural for human beings, but is still a non-trivial task for machines. The persona-based dialogue generation task is thus introduced to tackle the personalityinconsistent problem by incorporating explicit persona text into dialogue generation models. Despite the success of existing personabased models on generating human-like responses, their one-stage decoding framework can hardly avoid the generation of inconsistent persona words. In this work, we introduce a three-stage framework that employs a generate-delete-rewrite mechanism to delete inconsistent words from a generated response prototype and further rewrite it to a personality-consistent one. We carry out evaluations by both human and automatic metrics. Experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset show that our approach achieves good performance.","{'sequence': 'Maintaining a consistent personality in conversations is quite natural for human beings, but is still a non-trivial task for machines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Image-Chat: Engaging Grounded Conversations,"To achieve the long-term goal of machines being able to engage humans in conversation, our models should captivate the interest of their speaking partners.

In this work we study large-scale architectures and datasets for this goal. We test a set of neural architectures using state-of-the-art image and text representations, considering various ways to fuse the components. To test such models, we collect a dataset of grounded human-human conversations, where speakers are asked to play roles given a provided emotional mood or style, as the use of such traits is also a key factor in engagingness (Guo et al., 2019) . Our dataset, Image-Chat, consists of 202k dialogues over 202k images using 215 possible style traits. Automatic metrics and human evaluations of engagingness show the efficacy of our approach; in particular, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the existing IGC task, and our best performing model is almost on par with humans on the Image-Chat test set (preferred 47.7% of the time).","{'sequence': 'To achieve the long-term goal of machines being able to engage humans in conversation, our models should captivate the interest of their speaking partners.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Can You Put it All Together: Evaluating Conversational Agents' Ability to Blend Skills,"Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent. Previous work has introduced tasks and datasets that aim to help agents to learn those qualities in isolation and gauge how well they can express them. But rather than being specialized in one single quality, a good open-domain conversational agent should be able to seamlessly blend them all into one cohesive conversational flow. In this work, we investigate several ways to combine models trained towards isolated capabilities, ranging from simple model aggregation schemes that require minimal additional training, to various forms of multi-task training that encompass several skills at all training stages. We further propose a new dataset, Blended-SkillTalk, to analyze how these capabilities would mesh together in a natural conversation, and compare the performance of different architectures and training schemes. Our experiments show that multi-tasking over several tasks that focus on particular capabilities results in better blended conversation performance compared to models trained on a single skill, and that both unified or two-stage approaches perform well if they are constructed to avoid unwanted bias in skill selection or are fine-tuned on our new task.","{'sequence': 'Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Contextual Hierarchical Attention Network with Adaptive Objective for Dialogue State Tracking,"Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs. However, most of them have limitations to efficiently exploit relevant context due to the lack of a powerful mechanism for modeling interactions between the slot and the dialogue history. Besides, existing methods usually ignore the slot imbalance problem and treat all slots indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard slots and eventually hurts overall performance. In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations. We further propose an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training. Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new stateof-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%). 1","{'sequence': 'Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs.

Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new stateof-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%). 1', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'NLP Applications', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Question Answering', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09126639366149902, 0.08766941726207733, 0.06775926053524017, 0.06266595423221588, 0.05300749093294144, 0.051908113062381744, 0.050272971391677856, 0.048070307821035385, 0.044217195361852646, 0.041557811200618744, 0.04101104289293289, 0.03981854394078255, 0.03597782924771309, 0.033843349665403366, 0.032964590936899185, 0.03294488415122032, 0.032018400728702545, 0.029010333120822906, 0.028947507962584496, 0.026477007195353508, 0.026370786130428314, 0.02128595858812332, 0.020934762433171272]}",0.09126639366149902,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.09126639366149902
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Meta-Reinforced Multi-Domain State Generator for Dialogue Systems,"A Dialogue State Tracker (DST) is a core component of a modular task-oriented dialogue system. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years. However, the major challenges remain. The state-of-the-art accuracy for DST is below 50% for a multi-domain dialogue task. A learnable DST for any new domain requires a large amount of labeled indomain data and training from scratch. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Reinforced Multi-Domain State Generator (MERET). Our first contribution is to improve the DST accuracy. We enhance a neural model based DST generator with a reward manager, which is built on policy gradient reinforcement learning (R-L) to fine-tune the generator. With this change, we are able to improve the joint accuracy of DST from 48.79% to 50.91% on the Multi-WOZ corpus. Second, we explore to train a DST meta-learning model with a few domains as source domains and a new domain as target domain. We apply the model-agnostic metalearning (MAML) algorithm to DST and the obtained meta-learning model is used for new domain adaptation. Our experimental results show this solution is able to outperform the traditional training approach with extremely less training data in target domain.","{'sequence': 'A Dialogue State Tracker (DST) is a core component of a modular task-oriented dialogue system.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Few-shot Slot Tagging with Collapsed Dependency Transfer and Label-enhanced Task-adaptive Projection Network,"In this paper, we explore the slot tagging with only a few labeled support sentences (a.k.a. few-shot). Few-shot slot tagging faces a unique challenge compared to the other fewshot classification problems as it calls for modeling the dependencies between labels. But it is hard to apply previously learned label dependencies to an unseen domain, due to the discrepancy of label sets. To tackle this, we introduce a collapsed dependency transfer mechanism into the conditional random field (CRF) to transfer abstract label dependency patterns as transition scores. In the few-shot setting, the emission score of CRF can be calculated as a word's similarity to the representation of each label. To calculate such similarity, we propose a Label-enhanced Task-Adaptive Projection Network (L-TapNet) based on the stateof-the-art few-shot classification model -Tap-Net, by leveraging label name semantics in representing labels.

In particular, we model utterance embeddings with a Gaussian mixture distribution and inject dynamic class semantic information into Gaussian means, which enables learning more classconcentrated embeddings that help to facilitate downstream outlier detection.

The benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of boosting the performance of both NLU and NLG. 1', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Question Answering', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.16639447212219238, 0.08666565269231796, 0.071248359978199, 0.05869539827108383, 0.04744747653603554, 0.046881817281246185, 0.04515622556209564, 0.0439821295440197, 0.04345738887786865, 0.03950907289981842, 0.03634126856923103, 0.03560192510485649, 0.035570986568927765, 0.03331703320145607, 0.0323699526488781, 0.028572818264365196, 0.02607874572277069, 0.02525837905704975, 0.022616224363446236, 0.021788645535707474, 0.021462446078658104, 0.02087770774960518, 0.010705800727009773]}",0.16639447212219238,Speech and Multimodality,0.071248359978199

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dynamic Fusion Network for Multi-Domain End-to-end Task-Oriented Dialog,"Recent studies have shown remarkable success in end-to-end task-oriented dialog system. However, most neural models rely on large training data, which are only available for a certain number of task domains, such as navigation and scheduling. This makes it difficult to scalable for a new domain with limited labeled data. However, there has been relatively little research on how to effectively use data from all domains to improve the performance of each domain and also unseen domains. To this end, we investigate methods that can make explicit use of domain knowledge and introduce a shared-private network to learn shared and specific knowledge. In addition, we propose a novel Dynamic Fusion Network (DF-Net) which automatically exploit the relevance between the target domain and each domain. Results show that our model outperforms existing methods on multi-domain dialogue, giving the state-of-the-art in the literature.

We then present a novel CG grounded policy learning framework that conducts dialog flow planning by graph traversal, which learns to identify a what-vertex and a how-vertex from the CG at each turn to guide response generation. In this way, we effectively leverage the CG to facilitate policy learning as follows: (1) it enables more effective long-term reward design, (2) it provides high-quality candidate actions, and (3) it gives us more control over the policy.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,End-to-End Neural Pipeline for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems using GPT-2,"The goal-oriented dialogue system needs to be optimized for tracking the dialogue flow and carrying out an effective conversation under various situations to meet the user goal.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning an Unreferenced Metric for Online Dialogue Evaluation,"Evaluating the quality of a dialogue interaction between two agents is a difficult task, especially in open-domain chit-chat style dialogue. There have been recent efforts to develop automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, but most of them do not generalize to unseen datasets and/or need a human-generated reference response during inference, making it infeasible for online evaluation. Here, we propose an unreferenced automated evaluation metric that uses large pre-trained language models to extract latent representations of utterances, and leverages the temporal transitions that exist between them. We show that our model achieves higher correlation with human annotations in an online setting, while not requiring true responses for comparison during inference.","{'sequence': 'Evaluating the quality of a dialogue interaction between two agents is a difficult task, especially in open-domain chit-chat style dialogue.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Zero-Shot Transfer Learning with Synthesized Data for Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking,Zero-shot transfer learning for multi-domain dialogue state tracking can allow us to handle new domains without incurring the high cost of data acquisition. This paper proposes new zero-short transfer learning technique for dialogue state tracking where the in-domain training data are all synthesized from an abstract dialogue model and the ontology of the domain. We show that data augmentation through synthesized data can improve the accuracy of zero-shot learning for both the TRADE model and the BERT-based SUMBT model on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. We show training with only synthesized in-domain data on the SUMBT model can reach about 2/3 of the accuracy obtained with the full training dataset. We improve the zero-shot learning state of the art on average across domains by 21%.,"{'sequence': 'Zero-shot transfer learning for multi-domain dialogue state tracking can allow us to handle new domains without incurring the high cost of data acquisition.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Data Manipulation: Towards Effective Instance Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation via Learning to Augment and Reweight,"Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm. As such, a reliable training corpus is the crux of building a robust and well-behaved dialogue model. However, due to the open-ended nature of human conversations, the quality of user-generated training data varies greatly, and effective training samples are typically insufficient while noisy samples frequently appear. This impedes the learning of those data-driven neural dialogue models. Therefore, effective dialogue learning requires not only more reliable learning samples, but also fewer noisy samples. In this paper, we propose a data manipulation framework to proactively reshape the data distribution towards reliable samples by augmenting and highlighting effective learning samples as well as reducing the effect of inefficient samples simultaneously. In particular, the data manipulation model selectively augments the training samples and assigns an importance weight to each instance to reform the training data. Note that, the proposed data manipulation framework is fully data-driven and learnable. It not only manipulates training samples to optimize the dialogue generation model, but also learns to increase its manipulation skills through gradient descent with validation samples. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the dialogue generation performance with respect to various automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments.","{'sequence': 'Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm.

Discourse and Pragmatics,TransS-Driven Joint Learning Architecture for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition,"Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task due to the lack of connectives as strong linguistic clues. Previous methods primarily encode two arguments separately or extract the specific interaction patterns for the task, which have not fully exploited the annotated relation signal. Therefore, we propose a novel TransS-driven joint learning architecture to address the issues. Specifically, based on the multi-level encoder, we 1) translate discourse relations in low-dimensional embedding space (called TransS), which could mine the latent geometric structure information of argumentrelation instances; 2) further exploit the semantic features of arguments to assist discourse understanding; 3) jointly learn 1) and 2) to mutually reinforce each other to obtain the better argument representations, so as to improve the performance of the task. Extensive experimental results on the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) show that our model achieves competitive results against several state-of-the-art systems.","{'sequence': 'Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task due to the lack of connectives as strong linguistic clues.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Bridging Anaphora Resolution as Question Answering,"Most previous studies on bridging anaphora resolution (Poesio et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2013b; Hou, 2018a) use the pairwise model to tackle the problem and assume that the gold mention information is given. In this paper, we cast bridging anaphora resolution as question answering based on context. This allows us to find the antecedent for a given anaphor without knowing any gold mention information (except the anaphor itself). We present a question answering framework (BARQA) for this task, which leverages the power of transfer learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to generate a large amount of ""quasi-bridging"" training data.

Discourse and Pragmatics,A Top-down Neural Architecture towards Text-level Parsing of Discourse Rhetorical Structure,"Due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years. However, all the previous studies on text-level discourse parsing adopt bottom-up approaches, which much limit the DRS determination on local information and fail to well benefit from global information of the overall discourse. In this paper, we justify from both computational and perceptive points-of-view that the top-down architecture is more suitable for textlevel DRS parsing. On the basis, we propose a top-down neural architecture toward text-level DRS parsing. In particular, we cast discourse parsing as a recursive split point ranking task, where a split point is classified to different levels according to its rank and the elementary discourse units (EDUs) associated with it are arranged accordingly. In this way, we can determine the complete DRS as a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack. Experimentation on both the English RST-DT corpus and the Chinese CDTB corpus shows the great effectiveness of our proposed top-down approach towards textlevel DRS parsing.","{'sequence': 'Due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Implicit Discourse Relation Classification: We Need to Talk about Evaluation,"Implicit relation classification on Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) 2.0 is a common benchmark task for evaluating the understanding of discourse relations. However, the lack of consistency in preprocessing and evaluation poses challenges to fair comparison of results in the literature. In this work, we highlight these inconsistencies and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Paired with this protocol, we report strong baseline results from pretrained sentence encoders, which set the new state-of-the-art for PDTB 2.0. Furthermore, this work is the first to explore fine-grained relation classification on PDTB 3.0. We expect our work to serve as a point of comparison for future work, and also as an initiative to discuss models of larger context and possible data augmentations for downstream transferability.","{'sequence': 'Implicit relation classification on Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) 2.0 is a common benchmark task for evaluating the understanding of discourse relations.

Ethics and NLP,Double-Hard Debias: Tailoring Word Embeddings for Gender Bias Mitigation,"Word embeddings derived from humangenerated corpora inherit strong gender bias which can be further amplified by downstream models. Some commonly adopted debiasing approaches, including the seminal Hard Debias algorithm (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) , apply post-processing procedures that project pre-trained word embeddings into a subspace orthogonal to an inferred gender subspace. We discover that semantic-agnostic corpus regularities such as word frequency captured by the word embeddings negatively impact the performance of these algorithms. We propose a simple but effective technique, Double-Hard Debias, which purifies the word embeddings against such corpus regularities prior to inferring and removing the gender subspace.

Ethics and NLP,Social Bias Frames: Reasoning about Social and Power Implications of Language,"Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES from unstructured text. We find that while stateof-the-art neural models are effective at highlevel categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F 1 ), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.","{'sequence': 'Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.

Ethics and NLP,Is Your Classifier Actually Biased? Measuring Fairness under Uncertainty with Bernstein Bounds,"Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity). However, manually annotating a large dataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating all the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to estimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated sample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias. In this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty about the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence that a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true bias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call Bernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed biased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim. Our findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific biases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious cases. For example, consider a coreference resolution system that is 5% more accurate on gender-stereotypical sentences -to claim it is biased with 95% confidence, we need a bias-specific dataset that is 3.8 times larger than WinoBias, the largest available.","{'sequence': 'Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity).

Through these studies, conducted on English text, we confirm that without acknowledging and building systems that recognize the complexity of gender, we build systems that lead to many potential harms.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.08332868665456772, 0.07394640147686005, 0.07012715190649033, 0.0664825364947319, 0.06289194524288177, 0.06097293272614479, 0.056849539279937744, 0.05262688919901848, 0.04867580160498619, 0.04343762248754501, 0.03998856246471405, 0.03899803012609482, 0.036830730736255646, 0.03406640142202377, 0.03248711675405502, 0.03180987387895584, 0.029408100992441177, 0.02807202935218811, 0.025021107867360115, 0.024578247219324112, 0.024435076862573624, 0.01751776970922947, 0.017447464168071747]}",0.08332868665456772,Question Answering,0.05262688919901848
Ethics and NLP,Gender Bias in Multilingual Embeddings and Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Multilingual representations embed words from many languages into a single semantic space such that words with similar meanings are close to each other regardless of the language. These embeddings have been widely used in various settings, such as cross-lingual transfer, where a natural language processing (NLP) model trained on one language is deployed to another language. While the crosslingual transfer techniques are powerful, they carry gender bias from the source to target languages. In this paper, we study gender bias in multilingual embeddings and how it affects transfer learning for NLP applications. We create a multilingual dataset for bias analysis and propose several ways for quantifying bias in multilingual representations from both the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives. Experimental results show that the magnitude of bias in the multilingual representations changes differently when we align the embeddings to different target spaces and that the alignment direction can also have an influence on the bias in transfer learning. We further provide recommendations for using the multilingual word representations for downstream tasks.","{'sequence': 'Multilingual representations embed words from many languages into a single semantic space such that words with similar meanings are close to each other regardless of the language.

Ethics and NLP,Towards Debiasing Sentence Representations,"As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes. Previous work has revealed the presence of social biases in widely used word embeddings involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. While some methods were proposed to debias these word-level embeddings, there is a need to perform debiasing at the sentence-level given the recent shift towards new contextualized sentence representations such as ELMo and BERT. In this paper, we investigate the presence of social biases in sentence-level representations and propose a new method, SENT-DEBIAS, to reduce these biases. We show that SENT-DEBIAS is effective in removing biases, and at the same time, preserves performance on sentence-level downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and natural language understanding. We hope that our work will inspire future research on characterizing and removing social biases from widely adopted sentence representations for fairer NLP.","{'sequence': 'As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes.

Ethics and NLP,Towards Understanding Gender Bias in Relation Extraction,"Recent developments in Neural Relation Extraction (NRE) have made significant strides towards automated knowledge base construction. While much attention has been dedicated towards improvements in accuracy, there have been no attempts in the literature to evaluate social biases exhibited in NRE systems. In this paper, we create WikiGenderBias, a distantly supervised dataset composed of over 45,000 sentences including a 10% human annotated test set for the purpose of analyzing gender bias in relation extraction systems. We find that when extracting spouse and hypernym (i.e., occupation) relations, an NRE system performs differently when the gender of the target entity is different. However, such disparity does not appear when extracting relations such as birth date or birth place. We also analyze two existing bias mitigation techniques, word embedding debiasing and data augmentation. Unfortunately, due to NRE models relying heavily on surface level cues, we find that existing bias mitigation approaches have a negative effect on NRE. Our analysis lays groundwork for future quantifying and mitigating bias in relation extraction.","{'sequence': 'Recent developments in Neural Relation Extraction (NRE) have made significant strides towards automated knowledge base construction.

Ethics and NLP,Demographics Should Not Be the Reason of Toxicity: Mitigating Discrimination in Text Classifications with Instance Weighting,"With the recent proliferation of the use of text classifications, researchers have found that there are certain unintended biases in text classification datasets. For example, texts containing some demographic identity-terms (e.g., ""gay"", ""black"") are more likely to be abusive in existing abusive language detection datasets. As a result, models trained with these datasets may consider sentences like ""She makes me happy to be gay"" as abusive simply because of the word ""gay."" In this paper, we formalize the unintended biases in text classification datasets as a kind of selection bias from the non-discrimination distribution to the discrimination distribution. Based on this formalization, we further propose a model-agnostic debiasing training framework by recovering the non-discrimination distribution using instance weighting, which does not require any extra resources or annotations apart from a pre-defined set of demographic identity-terms. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively alleviate the impacts of the unintended biases without significantly hurting models' generalization ability.","{'sequence': 'With the recent proliferation of the use of text classifications, researchers have found that there are certain unintended biases in text classification datasets.

SeqGFMN is stable to train and outperforms various adversarial approaches for text generation and text style transfer.', 'labels': ['Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.3440442681312561, 0.06908593326807022, 0.06290506571531296, 0.04603094607591629, 0.0459938608109951, 0.04263055697083473, 0.04190210998058319, 0.040338341146707535, 0.034070439636707306, 0.03405715152621269, 0.03383680805563927, 0.030401762574911118, 0.022996772080659866, 0.02267642877995968, 0.021879443898797035, 0.02144615724682808, 0.019896095618605614, 0.019632423296570778, 0.011731687933206558, 0.011568776331841946, 0.010383063927292824, 0.007052098400890827, 0.005439805798232555]}",0.3440442681312561,Generation,0.3440442681312561
Generation,Fact-based Text Editing,"We propose a novel text editing task, referred to as fact-based text editing, in which the goal is to revise a given document to better describe the facts in a knowledge base (e.g., several triples). The task is important in practice because reflecting the truth is a common requirement in text editing. First, we propose a method for automatically generating a dataset for research on fact-based text editing, where each instance consists of a draft text, a revised text, and several facts represented in triples. We apply the method into two public tableto-text datasets, obtaining two new datasets consisting of 233k and 37k instances, respectively. Next, we propose a new neural network architecture for fact-based text editing, called FACTEDITOR, which edits a draft text by referring to given facts using a buffer, a stream, and a memory. A straightforward approach to address the problem would be to employ an encoder-decoder model. Our experimental results on the two datasets show that FACTE-DITOR outperforms the encoder-decoder approach in terms of fidelity and fluency. The results also show that FACTEDITOR conducts inference faster than the encoder-decoder approach.","{'sequence': 'We propose a novel text editing task, referred to as fact-based text editing, in which the goal is to revise a given document to better describe the facts in a knowledge base (e.g., several triples).

Generation,Expertise Style Transfer: A New Task Towards Better Communication between Experts and Laymen,"The curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen. We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. Solving this task not only simplifies the professional language, but also improves the accuracy and expertise level of laymen descriptions using simple words. This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five stateof-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github. io/expertise-style-transfer/. Many cause dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or both. The most common symptoms, regardless of the type of fluid in the pleural space or its cause, are shortness of breath and chest pain. About 1/1000 hypertensive patients has a pheochromocytoma. The incidence of Pheochromocytomas may be quite small. The lesion slowly enlarges, often ulcerates, and spread to other skin areas. Lesions heal slowly, with scarring. The sores slowly enlarge and spread to nearby tissue, causing further damage. Sores heal slowly and may result in permanent scarring. In patients with papilledema, vision is usually not affected initially, but seconds-long graying out of vision, flickering, or blurred or double vision may occur. At first, papilledema may be present without affecting vision. Fleeting vision changes (blurred vision, double vision, flickering, or complete loss of vision) typically lasting seconds are characteristic of papilledema.","{'sequence': 'The curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen.

We propose to tackle this problem by leveraging richer training signals that can guide our model for preserving input information. In particular, we introduce two types of autoencoding losses, each individually focusing on different aspects (a.k.a. views) of input graphs.

Generation,Bridging the Structural Gap Between Encoding and Decoding for Data-To-Text Generation,"Generating sequential natural language descriptions from graph-structured data (e.g., knowledge graph) is challenging, partly because of the structural differences between the input graph and the output text. Hence, popular sequence-to-sequence models, which require serialized input, are not a natural fit for this task. Graph neural networks, on the other hand, can better encode the input graph but broaden the structural gap between the encoder and decoder, making faithful generation difficult. To narrow this gap, we propose DUA-LENC, a dual encoding model that can not only incorporate the graph structure, but can also cater to the linear structure of the output text. Empirical comparisons with strong single-encoder baselines demonstrate that dual encoding can significantly improve the quality of the generated text.","{'sequence': 'Generating sequential natural language descriptions from graph-structured data (e.g., knowledge graph) is challenging, partly because of the structural differences between the input graph and the output text.

Generation,Automatic Poetry Generation from Prosaic Text,"In the last few years, a number of successful approaches have emerged that are able to adequately model various aspects of natural language. In particular, language models based on neural networks have improved the state of the art with regard to predictive language modeling, while topic models are successful at capturing clear-cut, semantic dimensions.

As an alternative, prior work has shown that minimizing the distinguishability of generated samples is a principled and robust loss that can handle invalid references. However, distinguishability has not been used in practice due to challenges in optimization and estimation. We propose loss truncation: a simple and scalable procedure which adaptively removes high log loss examples as a way to optimize for distinguishability.

Generation,A Knowledge-Enhanced Pretraining Model for Commonsense Story Generation,"Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task. In spite of the success in modeling fluency and local coherence, existing neural language generation models (e.g., GPT-2) still suffer from repetition, logic conflicts, and lack of long-range coherence in generated stories. We conjecture that this is because of the difficulty of associating relevant commonsense knowledge, understanding the causal relationships, and planning entities and events with proper temporal order. In this paper, we devise a knowledge-enhanced pretraining model for commonsense story generation. We propose to utilize commonsense knowledge from external knowledge bases to generate reasonable stories. To further capture the causal and temporal dependencies between the sentences in a reasonable story, we use multi-task learning, which combines a discriminative objective to distinguish true and fake stories during fine-tuning. Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more reasonable stories than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in terms of logic and global coherence.","{'sequence': 'Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task.

Generation,Shape of Synth to Come: Why We Should Use Synthetic Data for English Surface Realization,"The Surface Realization Shared Tasks of 2018 and 2019 were Natural Language Generation shared tasks with the goal of exploring approaches to surface realization from Universal-Dependency-like trees to surface strings for several languages. In the 2018 shared task there was very little difference in the absolute performance of systems trained with and without additional, synthetically created data, and a new rule prohibiting the use of synthetic data was introduced for the 2019 shared task. Contrary to the findings of the 2018 shared task, we show, in experiments on the English 2018 dataset, that the use of synthetic data can have a substantial positive effect -an improvement of almost 8 BLEU points for a previously state-of-the-art system.

Generation,Reverse Engineering Configurations of Neural Text Generation Models,"This paper seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of neural text generations models. The study of artifacts that emerge in machine generated text as a result of modeling choices is a nascent research area. Previously, the extent and degree to which these artifacts surface in generated text has not been well studied. In the spirit of better understanding generative text models and their artifacts, we propose the new task of distinguishing which of several variants of a given model generated a piece of text, and we conduct an extensive suite of diagnostic tests to observe whether modeling choices (e.g., sampling methods, top-k probabilities, model architectures, etc.) leave detectable artifacts in the text they generate. Our key finding, which is backed by a rigorous set of experiments, is that such artifacts are present and that different modeling choices can be inferred by observing the generated text alone. This suggests that neural text generators may be more sensitive to various modeling choices than previously thought.","{'sequence': 'This paper seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of neural text generations models.

Generation,Politeness Transfer: A Tag and Generate Approach,"This paper introduces a new task of politeness transfer which involves converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning. We also provide a dataset of more than 1.39 million instances automatically labeled for politeness to encourage benchmark evaluations on this new task. We design a tag and generate pipeline that identifies stylistic attributes and subsequently generates a sentence in the target style while preserving most of the source content. For politeness as well as five other transfer tasks, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics for content preservation, with a comparable or better performance on style transfer accuracy. Additionally, our model surpasses existing methods on human evaluations for grammaticality, meaning preservation and transfer accuracy across all the six style transfer tasks. The data and code is located at https:// github.com/tag-and-generate/ Introduction Politeness plays a crucial role in social interaction, and is closely tied with power dynamics, social distance between the participants of a conversation, and gender (Brown et al., 1987; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013) . It is also imperative to use the appropriate level of politeness for smooth communication in conversations (Coppock, 2005) , organizational settings like emails (Peterson et al., 2011) , memos, official documents, and many other settings.

Generation,Learning to Ask More: Semi-Autoregressive Sequential Question Generation under Dual-Graph Interaction,"Traditional Question Generation (TQG) aims to generate a question given an input passage and an answer. When there is a sequence of answers, we can perform Sequential Question Generation (SQG) to produce a series of interconnected questions. Since the frequently occurred information omission and coreference between questions, SQG is rather challenging. Prior works regarded SQG as a dialog generation task and recurrently produced each question. However, they suffered from problems caused by error cascades and could only capture limited context dependencies. To this end, we generate questions in a semi-autoregressive way. Our model divides questions into different groups and generates each group of them in parallel. During this process, it builds two graphs focusing on information from passages, answers respectively and performs dual-graph interaction to get information for generation. Besides, we design an answer-aware attention mechanism and the coarse-to-fine generation scenario.

Generation,Logical Natural Language Generation from Open-Domain Tables,"Neural natural language generation (NLG) models have recently shown remarkable progress in fluency and coherence. However, existing studies on neural NLG are primarily focused on surface-level realizations with limited emphasis on logical inference, an important aspect of human thinking and language. In this paper, we suggest a new NLG task where a model is tasked with generating natural language statements that can be logically entailed by the facts in an open-domain semi-structured table . To facilitate the study of the proposed logical NLG problem, we use the existing Tab-Fact dataset (Chen et al., 2019) featured with a wide range of logical/symbolic inferences as our testbed, and propose new automatic metrics to evaluate the fidelity of generation models w.r.t. logical inference.

Generation,ESPRIT: Explaining Solutions to Physical Reasoning Tasks,"Neural networks lack the ability to reason about qualitative physics and so cannot generalize to scenarios and tasks unseen during training. We propose ESPRIT, a framework for commonsense reasoning about qualitative physics in natural language that generates interpretable descriptions of physical events. We use a two-step approach of first identifying the pivotal physical events in an environment and then generating natural language descriptions of those events using a data-to-text approach. Our framework learns to generate explanations of how the physical simulation will causally evolve so that an agent or a human can easily reason about a solution using those interpretable descriptions.

Generation,Improving Image Captioning with Better Use of Caption,"Image captioning is a multimodal problem that has drawn extensive attention in both the natural language processing and computer vision community. In this paper, we present a novel image captioning architecture to better explore semantics available in captions and leverage that to enhance both image representation and caption generation. Our models first construct caption-guided visual relationship graphs that introduce beneficial inductive bias using weakly supervised multi-instance learning. The representation is then enhanced with neighbouring and contextual nodes with their textual and visual features. During generation, the model further incorporates visual relationships using multi-task learning for jointly predicting word and object/predicate tag sequences. We perform extensive experiments on the MSCOCO dataset, showing that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the baselines, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of evaluation metrics.

Generation,Generating Diverse and Consistent QA pairs from Contexts with Information-Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional VAEs,"One of the most crucial challenges in question answering (QA) is the scarcity of labeled data, since it is costly to obtain question-answer (QA) pairs for a target text domain with human annotation.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE) for generating QA pairs given unstructured texts as contexts, while maximizing the mutual information between generated QA pairs to ensure their consistency. We validate our Information Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (Info-HCVAE) on several benchmark datasets by evaluating the performance of the QA model (BERT-base) using only the generated QA pairs (QA-based evaluation) or by using both the generated and human-labeled pairs (semisupervised learning) for training, against stateof-the-art baseline models.

In this paper, we aim to extend the capabilities of language models (LMs) to the more general task of infilling. To this end, we train (or fine-tune) off-the-shelf LMs on sequences containing the concatenation of artificially-masked text and the text which was masked.

We propose an approach that learns to correlate changes across two distinct language representations, to generate a sequence of edits that are applied to the existing comment to reflect the source code modifications.

Generation,Towards Faithful Neural Table-to-Text Generation with Content-Matching Constraints,"Text generation from a knowledge base aims to translate knowledge triples to naturallanguage descriptions. Most existing methods ignore the faithfulness between a generated text description and the original table, leading to generated information that goes beyond the content of the table. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel Transformerbased generation framework to achieve the goal. The core techniques in our method to enforce faithfulness include a new table-text optimal-transport matching loss and a tabletext embedding similarity loss based on the Transformer model. Furthermore, to evaluate faithfulness, we propose a new automatic metric specialized to the table-to-text generation problem. We also provide detailed analysis on each component of our model in our experiments.

Generation,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by ( 1 ) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new stateof-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance. 1","{'sequence': 'We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models.

Generation,Neural Syntactic Preordering for Controlled Paraphrase Generation,"Paraphrasing natural language sentences is a multifaceted process: it might involve replacing individual words or short phrases, local rearrangement of content, or high-level restructuring like topicalization or passivization.

First, given an input sentence, we derive a set of feasible syntactic rearrangements using an encoder-decoder model. This model operates over a partially lexical, partially syntactic view of the sentence and can reorder big chunks. Next, we use each proposed rearrangement to produce a sequence of position embeddings, which encourages our final encoder-decoder paraphrase model to attend to the source words in a particular order.

Generation,Distilling Knowledge Learned in BERT for Text Generation,"Large-scale pre-trained language model such as BERT has achieved great success in language understanding tasks. However, it remains an open question how to utilize BERT for language generation. In this paper, we present a novel approach, Conditional Masked Language Modeling (C-MLM), to enable the finetuning of BERT on target generation tasks. The finetuned BERT (teacher) is exploited as extra supervision to improve conventional Seq2Seq models (student) for better text generation performance.

Information Extraction,From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues,"Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing. The NLP community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios, but little attention has been given to CS in particular. This is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data, despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. In this paper, we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. Specifically, we transfer English knowledge from a pre-trained ELMo model to different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English) using the task of language identification. Our method, CS-ELMo, is an extension of ELMo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. We show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual BERT and homologous CS-unaware ELMo models and establishing a new state of the art in CS tasks, such as NER and POS tagging. Our technique can be expanded to more English-paired code-switched languages, providing more resources to the CS community.","{'sequence': 'Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing.

Information Extraction,Exploiting the Syntax-Model Consistency for Neural Relation Extraction,"This paper studies the task of Relation Extraction (RE) that aims to identify the semantic relations between two entity mentions in text. In the deep learning models for RE, it has been beneficial to incorporate the syntactic structures from the dependency trees of the input sentences. In such models, the dependency trees are often used to directly structure the network architectures or to obtain the dependency relations between the word pairs to inject the syntactic information into the models via multi-task learning. The major problems with these approaches are the lack of generalization beyond the syntactic structures in the training data or the failure to capture the syntactic importance of the words for RE. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning model for RE that uses the dependency trees to extract the syntax-based importance scores for the words, serving as a tree representation to introduce syntactic information into the models with greater generalization. In particular, we leverage Ordered-Neuron Long-Short Term Memory Networks (ON-LSTM) to infer the model-based importance scores for RE for every word in the sentences that are then regulated to be consistent with the syntax-based scores to enable syntactic information injection. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on three RE benchmark datasets.","{'sequence': 'This paper studies the task of Relation Extraction (RE) that aims to identify the semantic relations between two entity mentions in text.

In particular, we leverage Ordered-Neuron Long-Short Term Memory Networks (ON-LSTM) to infer the model-based importance scores for RE for every word in the sentences that are then regulated to be consistent with the syntax-based scores to enable syntactic information injection. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on three RE benchmark datasets.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0851655974984169, 0.07058822363615036, 0.06838355213403702, 0.06492048501968384, 0.06402336061000824, 0.06301167607307434, 0.061719801276922226, 0.05623101443052292, 0.04726795852184296, 0.045026808977127075, 0.04246065020561218, 0.03986517712473869, 0.03750327229499817, 0.034414224326610565, 0.03286116197705269, 0.03281183913350105, 0.032693974673748016, 0.02522868663072586, 0.024954522028565407, 0.024372467771172523, 0.02387300319969654, 0.012368245981633663, 0.010254246182739735]}",0.0851655974984169,Question Answering,0.06838355213403702
Information Extraction,A Joint Neural Model for Information Extraction with Global Features,"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a VICTIM of a DIE event is likely to be a VICTIM of an AT-TACK event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, ONEIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. ONEIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state-of-the-art on all subtasks. As ONEIE does not use any language-specific feature, we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner.

Information Extraction,Relabel the Noise: Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations via Cooperative Multiagents,"Distant supervision based methods for entity and relation extraction have received increasing popularity due to the fact that these methods require light human annotation efforts. In this paper, we consider the problem of shifted label distribution, which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set, and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. We propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents. To handle noisy instances in a fine-grained manner, each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective; To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. Further, the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors.

Information Extraction,Reasoning with Latent Structure Refinement for Document-Level Relation Extraction,"Document-level relation extraction requires integrating information within and across multiple sentences of a document and capturing complex interactions between inter-sentence entities. However, effective aggregation of relevant information in the document remains a challenging research question. Existing approaches construct static document-level graphs based on syntactic trees, co-references or heuristics from the unstructured text to model the dependencies. Unlike previous methods that may not be able to capture rich non-local interactions for inference, we propose a novel model that empowers the relational reasoning across sentences by automatically inducing the latent document-level graph.

Information Extraction,TACRED Revisited: A Thorough Evaluation of the TACRED Relation Extraction Task,"TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017)  is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE). But, even with recent advances in unsupervised pretraining and knowledge enhanced neural RE, models still show a high error rate. In this paper, we investigate the questions: Have we reached a performance ceiling or is there still room for improvement? And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models. We show that two groups of ambiguous relations are responsible for most of the remaining errors and that models may adopt shallow heuristics on the dataset when entities are not masked.","{'sequence': 'TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017)  is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE).

Information Extraction,Continual Relation Learning via Episodic Memory Activation and Reconsolidation,"Continual relation learning aims to continually train a model on new data to learn incessantly emerging novel relations while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old relations. Some pioneering work has proved that storing a handful of historical relation examples in episodic memory and replaying them in subsequent training is an effective solution for such a challenging problem. However, these memorybased methods usually suffer from overfitting the few memorized examples of old relations, which may gradually cause inevitable confusion among existing relations. Inspired by the mechanism in human long-term memory formation, we introduce episodic memory activation and reconsolidation (EMAR) to continual relation learning. Every time neural models are activated to learn both new and memorized data, EMAR utilizes relation prototypes for memory reconsolidation exercise to keep a stable understanding of old relations. The experimental results show that EMAR could get rid of catastrophically forgetting old relations and outperform the state-of-the-art continual learning models.

Information Extraction,SciREX: A Challenge Dataset for Document-Level Information Extraction,"Extracting information from full documents is an important problem in many domains, but most previous work focus on identifying relationships within a sentence or a paragraph. It is challenging to create a large-scale information extraction (IE) dataset at the document level since it requires an understanding of the whole document to annotate entities and their document-level relationships that usually span beyond sentences or even sections. In this paper, we introduce SCIREX, a document level IE dataset that encompasses multiple IE tasks, including salient entity identification and document level N -ary relation identification from scientific articles.

Information Extraction,Improving Entity Linking through Semantic Reinforced Entity Embeddings,"Entity embeddings, which represent different aspects of each entity with a single vector like word embeddings, are a key component of neural entity linking models. Existing entity embeddings are learned from canonical Wikipedia articles and local contexts surrounding target entities. Such entity embeddings are effective, but too distinctive for linking models to learn contextual commonality. We propose a simple yet effective method, FGS2EE, to inject fine-grained semantic information into entity embeddings to reduce the distinctiveness and facilitate the learning of contextual commonality. FGS2EE first uses the embeddings of semantic type words to generate semantic embeddings, and then combines them with existing entity embeddings through linear aggregation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of such embeddings.

Information Extraction,Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking,"Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts. The first step of (X)EL is candidate generation, which retrieves a list of plausible candidate entities from the target-language KB for each mention. Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the realm of relatively high-resource languages, but these do not extend well to low-resource languages with few, if any, Wikipedia pages. Recently, transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in the lowresource languages by utilizing resources in closely related languages, but the performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate generation methods for low-resource XEL, then propose three improvements that (1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2) improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are simple, but effective: We experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets and find that they yield an average gain of 16.9% in TOP-30 gold candidate recall, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our improved model also yields an average gain of 7.9% in in-KB accuracy of end-to-end XEL. 1","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts.

Information Extraction,A Novel Cascade Binary Tagging Framework for Relational Triple Extraction,"Extracting relational triples from unstructured text is crucial for large-scale knowledge graph construction. However, few existing works excel in solving the overlapping triple problem where multiple relational triples in the same sentence share the same entities. In this work, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the relational triple extraction task and propose a novel cascade binary tagging framework (CASREL) derived from a principled problem formulation. Instead of treating relations as discrete labels as in previous works, our new framework models relations as functions that map subjects to objects in a sentence, which naturally handles the overlapping problem. Experiments show that the CAS-REL framework already outperforms state-ofthe-art methods even when its encoder module uses a randomly initialized BERT encoder, showing the power of the new tagging framework. It enjoys further performance boost when employing a pre-trained BERT encoder, outperforming the strongest baseline by 17.5 and 30.2 absolute gain in F1-score on two public datasets NYT and WebNLG, respectively.

Information Extraction,ReInceptionE: Relation-Aware Inception Network with Joint Local-Global Structural Information for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"The goal of Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to learn how to represent the lowdimensional vectors for entities and relations based on the observed triples. The conventional shallow models are limited to their expressiveness. ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018)   takes advantage of CNN and improves the expressive power with parameter efficient operators by increasing the interactions between head and relation embeddings. However, there is no structural information in the embedding space of ConvE, and the performance is still limited by the number of interactions. The recent KBGAT (Nathani et al.,  2019)  provides another way to learn embeddings by adaptively utilizing structural information. In this paper, we take the benefits of ConvE and KBGAT together and propose a Relation-aware Inception network with joint local-global structural information for knowledge graph Embedding (ReInceptionE). Specifically, we first explore the Inception network to learn query embedding, which aims to further increase the interactions between head and relation embeddings. Then, we propose to use a relation-aware attention mechanism to enrich the query embedding with the local neighborhood and global entity information. Experimental results on both WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets demonstrate that ReIncep-tionE achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.","{'sequence': 'The goal of Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to learn how to represent the lowdimensional vectors for entities and relations based on the observed triples.

Information Extraction,Single-/Multi-Source Cross-Lingual NER via Teacher-Student Learning on Unlabeled Data in Target Language,"To better tackle the named entity recognition (NER) problem on languages with little/no labeled data, cross-lingual NER must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data. Previous works on cross-lingual NER are mostly based on label projection with pairwise texts or direct model transfer. However, such methods either are not applicable if the labeled data in the source languages is unavailable, or do not leverage information contained in unlabeled data in the target language. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method to address such limitations, where NER models in the source languages are used as teachers to train a student model on unlabeled data in the target language. The proposed method works for both single-source and multi-source crosslingual NER. For the latter, we further propose a similarity measuring method to better weight the supervision from different teacher models.

Information Extraction,Simplify the Usage of Lexicon in Chinese NER,"Recently, many works have tried to augment the performance of Chinese named entity recognition (NER) using word lexicons. As a representative, Lattice-LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018) has achieved new benchmark results on several public Chinese NER datasets. However, Lattice-LSTM has a complex model architecture. This limits its application in many industrial areas where real-time NER responses are needed. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method for incorporating the word lexicon into the character representations. This method avoids designing a complicated sequence modeling architecture, and for any neural NER model, it requires only subtle adjustment of the character representation layer to introduce the lexicon information. Experimental studies on four benchmark Chinese NER datasets show that our method achieves an inference speed up to 6.15 times faster than those of state-ofthe-art methods, along with a better performance. The experimental results also show that the proposed method can be easily incorporated with pre-trained models like BERT. 1","{'sequence': 'Recently, many works have tried to augment the performance of Chinese named entity recognition (NER) using word lexicons.

Each span corresponds to a character or latent word and its position in the original lattice. With the power of Transformer and well-designed position encoding, FLAT can fully leverage the lattice information and has an excellent parallelization ability.

Our analysis reveals that CopyAttention produces a constant number of extractions per sentence, and its extracted tuples often express redundant information. We present IMOJIE, an extension to Copy-Attention, which produces the next extraction conditioned on all previously extracted tuples. This approach overcomes both shortcomings of CopyAttention, resulting in a variable number of diverse extractions per sentence. We train IMOJIE on training data bootstrapped from extractions of several non-neural systems, which have been automatically filtered to reduce redundancy and noise. IMOJIE outperforms CopyAttention by about 18 F1 pts, and a BERT-based strong baseline by 2 F1 pts, establishing a new state of the art for the task.","{'sequence': 'While traditional systems for Open Information Extraction were statistical and rule-based, recently neural models have been introduced for the task.

Information Extraction,Named Entity Recognition without Labelled Data: A Weak Supervision Approach,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training. When in-domain labelled data is available, transfer learning techniques can be used to adapt existing NER models to the target domain. But what should one do when there is no hand-labelled data for the target domain? This paper presents a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled data through weak supervision. The approach relies on a broad spectrum of labelling functions to automatically annotate texts from the target domain. These annotations are then merged together using a hidden Markov model which captures the varying accuracies and confusions of the labelling functions. A sequence labelling model can finally be trained on the basis of this unified annotation. We evaluate the approach on two English datasets (CoNLL 2003 and news articles from Reuters and Bloomberg) and demonstrate an improvement of about 7 percentage points in entity-level F 1 scores compared to an out-of-domain neural NER model.","{'sequence': 'Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training.

Information Extraction,Document-Level Event Role Filler Extraction using Multi-Granularity Contextualized Encoding,"Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual sentences to make extraction decisions. This is problematic when the information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-toend neural sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context captured affects the models' performance. To dynamically aggregate information captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity (e.g., the sentence-and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show that our best system performs substantially better than prior work. We also report findings on the relationship between context length and neural model performance on the task.","{'sequence': ""Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual sentences to make extraction decisions.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Feature Projection for Improved Text Classification,"In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels. For example, in sentiment classification, words like good and nice are indicative of the positive sentiment and words like bad and terrible are indicative of the negative sentiment. However, there are also many common features (e.g., words) that are not indicative of any specific class (e.g., voice and screen, which are common to both sentiment classes and are not discriminative for classification). Although deep learning has made significant progresses in generating discriminative features through its powerful representation learning, we believe there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel angle to further improve this representation learning, i.e., feature projection. This method projects existing features into the orthogonal space of the common features. The resulting projection is thus perpendicular to the common features and more discriminative for classification. We apply this new method to improve CNN, RNN, Transformer, and Bert based text classification and obtain markedly better results.","{'sequence': 'In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Empower Entity Set Expansion via Language Model Probing,"Entity set expansion, aiming at expanding a small seed entity set with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, is a critical task that benefits many downstream NLP and IR applications, such as question answering, query understanding, and taxonomy construction. Existing set expansion methods bootstrap the seed entity set by adaptively selecting context features and extracting new entities. A key challenge for entity set expansion is to avoid selecting ambiguous context features which will shift the class semantics and lead to accumulative errors in later iterations. In this study, we propose a novel iterative set expansion framework that leverages automatically generated class names to address the semantic drift issue. In each iteration, we select one positive and several negative class names by probing a pre-trained language model, and further score each candidate entity based on selected class names. Experiments on two datasets show that our framework generates high-quality class names and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.","{'sequence': 'Entity set expansion, aiming at expanding a small seed entity set with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, is a critical task that benefits many downstream NLP and IR applications, such as question answering, query understanding, and taxonomy construction.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Exclusive Hierarchical Decoding for Deep Keyphrase Generation,"Keyphrase generation (KG) aims to summarize the main ideas of a document into a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce. Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover, previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of previouslypredicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity of the generated keyphrases.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,CluHTM - Semantic Hierarchical Topic Modeling based on CluWords,"Hierarchical Topic modeling (HTM) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration. Despite advantages over traditional topic modeling, HTM poses its own challenges, such as (1) topic incoherence, (2) unreasonable (hierarchical) structure, and (3) issues related to the definition of the ""ideal"" number of topics and depth of the hierarchy. In this paper, we advance the stateof-the-art on HTM by means of the design and evaluation of CluHTM, a novel nonprobabilistic hierarchical matrix factorization aimed at solving the specific issues of HTM. CluHTM's novel contributions include: (i) the exploration of richer text representation that encapsulates both, global (dataset level) and local semantic information -when combined, these pieces of information help to solve the topic incoherence problem as well as issues related to the unreasonable structure; (ii) the exploitation of a stability analysis metric for defining the number of topics and the ""shape"" the hierarchical structure. In our evaluation, considering twelve datasets and seven stateof-the-art baselines, CluHTM outperformed the baselines in the vast majority of the cases, with gains of around 500% over the strongest state-of-the-art baselines.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Neural Topic Modeling with Bidirectional Adversarial Training,"Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a twoway projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6% is observed in accuracy.","{'sequence': 'Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6% is observed in accuracy.', 'labels': ['Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1185523122549057, 0.1095414087176323, 0.06741081923246384, 0.050971150398254395, 0.04869003966450691, 0.04731402546167374, 0.047094009816646576, 0.04688948392868042, 0.0458197183907032, 0.04441431537270546, 0.043342385441064835, 0.042731042951345444, 0.037776485085487366, 0.03543165326118469, 0.03319742530584335, 0.02913481742143631, 0.029107196256518364, 0.028751026839017868, 0.02574162371456623, 0.02255832776427269, 0.01818203367292881, 0.018061401322484016, 0.009287293069064617]}",0.1185523122549057,Generation,0.043342385441064835

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Generative Semantic Hashing Enhanced via Boltzmann Machines,"Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training, existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution, enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size, independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper, to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes, we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training, we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that, an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques, the entire model can be optimized efficiently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code, our model can achieve significant performance gains.","{'sequence': 'Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint.

Specifically, we leverage contextualized representations of word occurrences and seed word information to automatically differentiate multiple interpretations of the same word, and thus create a contextualized corpus. This contextualized corpus is further utilized to train the classifier and expand seed words in an iterative manner. This process not only adds new contextualized, highly label-indicative keywords but also disambiguates initial seed words, making our weak supervision fully contextualized.

To interpret model behaviors, we further design a linguistic acceptability task to reveal their abilities in identifying ungrammatical sentences and the position of errors. We find that fixed contextual encoders with a simple classifier trained on the prediction of sentence correctness are able to locate error positions.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,How does BERT's attention change when you fine-tune? An analysis methodology and a case study in negation scope,"Large pretrained language models like BERT, after fine-tuning to a downstream task, have achieved high performance on a variety of NLP problems. Yet explaining their decisions is difficult despite recent work probing their internal representations. We propose a procedure and analysis methods that take a hypothesis of how a transformer-based model might encode a linguistic phenomenon, and test the validity of that hypothesis based on a comparison between knowledge-related downstream tasks with downstream control tasks, and measurement of cross-dataset consistency. We apply this methodology to test BERT and RoBERTa on a hypothesis that some attention heads will consistently attend from a word in negation scope to the negation cue. We find that after fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa on a negation scope task, the average attention head improves its sensitivity to negation and its attention consistency across negation datasets compared to the pre-trained models. However, only the base models (not the large models) improve compared to a control task, indicating there is evidence for a shallow encoding of negation only in the base models.","{'sequence': 'Large pretrained language models like BERT, after fine-tuning to a downstream task, have achieved high performance on a variety of NLP problems.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Learning to Faithfully Rationalize by Construction,"In many settings it is important for one to be able to understand why a model made a particular prediction. In NLP this often entails extracting snippets of an input text 'responsible for' corresponding model output; when such a snippet comprises tokens that indeed informed the model's prediction, it is a faithful explanation. In some settings, faithfulness may be critical to ensure transparency. Lei et al. (2016) proposed a model to produce faithful rationales for neural text classification by defining independent snippet extraction and prediction modules. However, the discrete selection over input tokens performed by this method complicates training, leading to high variance and requiring careful hyperparameter tuning. We propose a simpler variant of this approach that provides faithful explanations by construction. In our scheme, named FRESH, arbitrary feature importance scores (e.g., gradients from a trained model) are used to induce binary labels over token inputs, which an extractor can be trained to predict. An independent classifier module is then trained exclusively on snippets provided by the extractor; these snippets thus constitute faithful explanations, even if the classifier is arbitrarily complex. In both automatic and manual evaluations we find that variants of this simple framework yield predictive performance superior to 'end-to-end' approaches, while being more general and easier to train. 1","{'sequence': ""In many settings it is important for one to be able to understand why a model made a particular prediction.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,"The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much these networks actually ""know"" about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten typologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research-plus Englishtotalling eleven languages.

Further, errors cannot be properly attributed to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other exceptional faults. We introduce influence paths, a causal account of structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the subsequent verb) into a set of gate-level or neuron-level paths. The set localizes and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g., attractors).

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An Analysis of the Utility of Explicit Negative Examples to Improve the Syntactic Abilities of Neural Language Models,"We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models. Negative examples here are incorrect words in a sentence, such as barks in *The dogs barks. Neural language models are commonly trained only on positive examples, a set of sentences in the training data, but recent studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In this paper, we first demonstrate that appropriately using negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement) will boost the model's robustness on them in English, with a negligible loss of perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level of subjectrelative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions.","{'sequence': ""We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models.

Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions."", 'labels': ['NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0664314553141594, 0.05726493149995804, 0.05659588426351547, 0.05538926646113396, 0.05415204167366028, 0.05134989321231842, 0.05101833865046501, 0.04832685738801956, 0.04773644357919693, 0.04504239559173584, 0.044873204082250595, 0.04418261721730232, 0.04415136203169823, 0.043403856456279755, 0.03826865181326866, 0.03723062574863434, 0.03614543005824089, 0.0359145812690258, 0.03498024493455887, 0.033786702901124954, 0.030942991375923157, 0.024483371526002884, 0.018328936770558357]}",0.0664314553141594,NLP Applications,0.05538926646113396
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Make Up Your Mind! Adversarial Generation of Inconsistent Natural Language Explanations,"To increase trust in artificial intelligence systems, a promising research direction consists of designing neural models capable of generating natural language explanations for their predictions. In this work, we show that such models are nonetheless prone to generating mutually inconsistent explanations, such as ""Because there is a dog in the image."" and ""Because there is no dog in the [same] image."", exposing flaws in either the decision-making process of the model or in the generation of the explanations. We introduce a simple yet effective adversarial framework for sanity checking models against the generation of inconsistent natural language explanations. Moreover, as part of the framework, we address the problem of adversarial attacks with full target sequences, a scenario that was not previously addressed in sequence-to-sequence attacks. Finally, we apply our framework on a state-of-the-art neural natural language inference model that provides natural language explanations for its predictions. Our framework shows that this model is capable of generating a significant number of inconsistent explanations. PREMISE: A guy in a red jacket is snowboarding in midair.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Obtaining Faithful Interpretations from Compositional Neural Networks,"Neural module networks (NMNs) are a popular approach for modeling compositionality: they achieve high accuracy when applied to problems in language and vision, while reflecting the compositional structure of the problem in the network architecture. However, prior work implicitly assumed that the structure of the network modules, describing the abstract reasoning process, provides a faithful explanation of the model's reasoning; that is, that all modules perform their intended behaviour. In this work, we propose and conduct a systematic evaluation of the intermediate outputs of NMNs on NLVR2 and DROP, two datasets which require composing multiple reasoning steps. We find that the intermediate outputs differ from the expected output, illustrating that the network structure does not provide a faithful explanation of model behaviour. To remedy that, we train the model with auxiliary supervision and propose particular choices for module architecture that yield much better faithfulness, at a minimal cost to accuracy.","{'sequence': ""Neural module networks (NMNs) are a popular approach for modeling compositionality: they achieve high accuracy when applied to problems in language and vision, while reflecting the compositional structure of the problem in the network architecture.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Analyzing analytical methods: The case of phonology in neural models of spoken language,"Given the fast development of analysis techniques for NLP and speech processing systems, few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method. As a step in this direction we study the case of representations of phonology in neural network models of spoken language. We use two commonly applied analytical techniques, diagnostic classifiers and representational similarity analysis, to quantify to what extent neural activation patterns encode phonemes and phoneme sequences. We manipulate two factors that can affect the outcome of analysis. First, we investigate the role of learning by comparing neural activations extracted from trained versus randomly-initialized models. Second, we examine the temporal scope of the activations by probing both local activations corresponding to a few milliseconds of the speech signal, and global activations pooled over the whole utterance. We conclude that reporting analysis results with randomly initialized models is crucial, and that global-scope methods tend to yield more consistent results and we recommend their use as a complement to local-scope diagnostic methods.","{'sequence': 'Given the fast development of analysis techniques for NLP and speech processing systems, few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

We survey the literature with respect to faithfulness evaluation, and arrange the current approaches around three assumptions, providing an explicit form to how faithfulness is ""defined"" by the community. We provide concrete guidelines on how evaluation of interpretation methods should and should not be conducted.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Roles and Utilization of Attention Heads in Transformer-based Neural Language Models,"Sentence encoders based on the transformer architecture have shown promising results on various natural language tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Understanding Attention for Text Classification,"Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, many researchers started to investigate the interpretability of attention on NLP tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Towards Transparent and Explainable Attention Models,"Recent studies on interpretability of attention distributions have led to notions of faithful and plausible explanations for a model's predictions. Attention distributions can be considered a faithful explanation if a higher attention weight implies a greater impact on the model's prediction. They can be considered a plausible explanation if they provide a humanunderstandable justification for the model's predictions. In this work, we first explain why current attention mechanisms in LSTM based encoders can neither provide a faithful nor a plausible explanation of the model's predictions. We observe that in LSTM based encoders the hidden representations at different time-steps are very similar to each other (high conicity) and attention weights in these situations do not carry much meaning because even a random permutation of the attention weights does not affect the model's predictions. Based on experiments on a wide variety of tasks and datasets, we observe attention distributions often attribute the model's predictions to unimportant words such as punctuation and fail to offer a plausible explanation for the predictions. To make attention mechanisms more faithful and plausible, we propose a modified LSTM cell with a diversity-driven training objective that ensures that the hidden representations learned at different time steps are diverse. We show that the resulting attention distributions offer more transparency as they (i) provide a more precise importance ranking of the hidden states (ii) are better indicative of words important for the model's predictions (iii) correlate better with gradient-based attribution methods.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,What BERT Is Not: Lessons from a New Suite of Psycholinguistic Diagnostics for Language Models,"Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Compositionality and Generalization In Emergent Languages,"Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality. In this paper, we study whether the language emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents. We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive.","{'sequence': 'Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Explaining Black Box Predictions and Unveiling Data Artifacts through Influence Functions,"Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously opaque. This has motivated the development of methods for interpreting such models, e.g., via gradient-based saliency maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular model prediction by highlighting important words in the corresponding input text. While this might be useful for tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by individual tokens in the input, we suspect that such highlighting is not always suitable for tasks where model decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate the use of influence functions for NLP, providing an alternative approach to interpreting neural text classifiers. Influence functions explain the decisions of a model by identifying influential training examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence functions have not yet been extensively evaluated in the context of NLP, a gap addressed by this work. We conduct a comparison between influence functions and common word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As suspected, we find that influence functions are particularly useful for natural language inference, a task in which 'saliency maps' may not provide clear interpretation. Furthermore, we develop a new quantitative measure based on influence functions that can reveal artifacts in training data. 1","{'sequence': ""Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously opaque.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Monolingual Representations,"State-of-the-art unsupervised multilingual models (e.g., multilingual BERT) have been shown to generalize in a zero-shot crosslingual setting. This generalization ability has been attributed to the use of a shared subword vocabulary and joint training across multiple languages giving rise to deep multilingual abstractions. We evaluate this hypothesis by designing an alternative approach that transfers a monolingual model to new languages at the lexical level. More concretely, we first train a transformer-based masked language model on one language, and transfer it to a new language by learning a new embedding matrix with the same masked language modeling objective-freezing parameters of all other layers. This approach does not rely on a shared vocabulary or joint training. However, we show that it is competitive with multilingual BERT on standard cross-lingual classification benchmarks and on a new Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset (XQuAD). Our results contradict common beliefs of the basis of the generalization ability of multilingual models and suggest that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalize across languages. We also release XQuAD as a more comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark, which comprises 240 paragraphs and 1190 question-answer pairs from SQuAD v1.1 translated into ten languages by professional translators.","{'sequence': 'State-of-the-art unsupervised multilingual models (e.g., multilingual BERT) have been shown to generalize in a zero-shot crosslingual setting.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Human Attention Maps for Text Classification: Do Humans and Neural Networks Focus on the Same Words?,"Motivated by human attention, computational attention mechanisms have been designed to help neural networks adjust their focus on specific parts of the input data. While attention mechanisms are claimed to achieve interpretability, little is known about the actual relationships between machine and human attention. In this work, we conduct the first quantitative assessment of human versus computational attention mechanisms for the text classification task. To achieve this, we design and conduct a large-scale crowd-sourcing study to collect human attention maps that encode the parts of a text that humans focus on when conducting text classification. Based on this new resource of human attention dataset for text classification, YELP-HAT, collected on the publicly available YELP dataset, we perform a quantitative comparative analysis of machine attention maps created by deep learning models and human attention maps. Our analysis offers insights into the relationships between human versus machine attention maps along three dimensions: overlap in word selections, distribution over lexical categories, and context-dependency of sentiment polarity.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Perturbed Masking: Parameter-free Probing for Analyzing and Interpreting BERT,"By introducing a small set of additional parameters, a probe learns to solve specific linguistic tasks (e.g., dependency parsing) in a supervised manner using feature representations (e.g., contextualized embeddings). The effectiveness of such probing tasks is taken as evidence that the pre-trained model encodes linguistic knowledge. However, this approach of evaluating a language model is undermined by the uncertainty of the amount of knowledge that is learned by the probe itself. Complementary to those works, we propose a parameter-free probing technique for analyzing pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT). Our method does not require direct supervision from the probing tasks, nor do we introduce additional parameters to the probing process. Our experiments on BERT show that syntactic trees recovered from BERT using our method are significantly better than linguistically-uninformed baselines. We further feed the empirically induced dependency structures into a downstream sentiment classification task and find its improvement compatible with or even superior to a human-designed dependency schema.","{'sequence': 'By introducing a small set of additional parameters, a probe learns to solve specific linguistic tasks (e.g., dependency parsing) in a supervised manner using feature representations (e.g., contextualized embeddings).

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Does Syntax Need to Grow on Trees? Sources of Hierarchical Inductive Bias in Sequence-to-Sequence Networks,"Learners that are exposed to the same training data might generalize differently due to differing inductive biases. In neural network models, inductive biases could in theory arise from any aspect of the model architecture. We investigate which architectural factors affect the generalization behavior of neural sequence-to-sequence models trained on two syntactic tasks, English question formation and English tense reinflection. For both tasks, the training set is consistent with a generalization based on hierarchical structure and a generalization based on linear order. All architectural factors that we investigated qualitatively affected how models generalized, including factors with no clear connection to hierarchical structure. For example, LSTMs and GRUs displayed qualitatively different inductive biases.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Interpreting Pretrained Contextualized Representations via Reductions to Static Embeddings,"Contextualized representations (e.g. ELMo, BERT) have become the default pretrained representations for downstream NLP applications. In some settings, this transition has rendered their static embedding predecessors (e.g. Word2Vec, GloVe) obsolete. As a side-effect, we observe that older interpretability methods for static embeddings -while more mature than those available for their dynamic counterparts -are underutilized in studying newer contextualized representations. Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models that share the same training data. Concerningly, we find dramatic inconsistencies between social bias estimators for word embeddings. 2 A humanist's outlook on the (in)accessibility of BERT: https://tedunderwood.com/2019/07/15/ do-humanists-need-bert/ The first is subword pooling: the application of a pooling mechanism over the k subword representations generated for w in context c in order to compute a single representation for w in c, i.e. {w 1 c , . . . , w k c } → w c . Beyond this, we define context combination to be the mapping from representations w c 1 , . . . , w cn of w in different contexts c 1 , . . . , c n to a single static embedding w that is agnostic of context.

Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, we show that the proposed VSLNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods; and adopting span-based QA framework is a promising direction to solve NLVL. 1', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Generation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Summarization', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10529488325119019, 0.08679047226905823, 0.06866727024316788, 0.05642635002732277, 0.05539603531360626, 0.05433171987533569, 0.053134750574827194, 0.04607575386762619, 0.04218198359012604, 0.04036549851298332, 0.038020193576812744, 0.037452809512615204, 0.036599382758140564, 0.03506496176123619, 0.03446456789970398, 0.034208133816719055, 0.034020230174064636, 0.03344633802771568, 0.031732022762298584, 0.030093954876065254, 0.022342735901474953, 0.017349030822515488, 0.00654086098074913]}",0.10529488325119019,Speech and Multimodality,0.037452809512615204

To address this issue, recent bias mitigation methods for VQA propose to incorporate visual cues (e.g., human attention maps) to better ground the VQA models, showcasing impressive gains. However, we show that the performance improvements are not a result of improved visual grounding, but a regularization effect which prevents over-fitting to linguistic priors.

Dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between people/objects, and diverse multimodal events are present in a video clip. Hence, it is important to develop automated models that can accurately extract such information from videos. Answering questions on videos is one of the tasks which can evaluate such AI abilities. In this paper, we propose a video question answering model which effectively integrates multi-modal input sources and finds the temporally relevant information to answer questions. Specifically, we first employ dense image captions to help identify objects and their detailed salient regions and actions, and hence give the model useful extra information (in explicit textual format to allow easier matching) for answering questions. Moreover, our model is also comprised of duallevel attention (word/object and frame level), multi-head self/cross-integration for different sources (video and dense captions), and gates which pass more relevant information to the classifier. Finally, we also cast the frame selection problem as a multi-label classification task and introduce two loss functions, In-and-Out Frame Score Margin (IOFSM) and Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (BBCE), to better supervise the model with human importance annotations. We evaluate our model on the challenging TVQA dataset, where each of our model components provides significant gains, and our overall model outperforms the stateof-the-art by a large margin (74.09% versus 70.52%).

Moreover, our model is also comprised of duallevel attention (word/object and frame level), multi-head self/cross-integration for different sources (video and dense captions), and gates which pass more relevant information to the classifier. Finally, we also cast the frame selection problem as a multi-label classification task and introduce two loss functions, In-and-Out Frame Score Margin (IOFSM) and Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (BBCE), to better supervise the model with human importance annotations. We evaluate our model on the challenging TVQA dataset, where each of our model components provides significant gains, and our overall model outperforms the stateof-the-art by a large margin (74.09% versus 70.52%). We also present several word, object, and frame level visualization studies. 1', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.6354929804801941, 0.09925941377878189, 0.033359602093696594, 0.019199781119823456, 0.01882598176598549, 0.017175059765577316, 0.016732454299926758, 0.01500313077121973, 0.013745380565524101, 0.013655397109687328, 0.01332590077072382, 0.012112060561776161, 0.011549243703484535, 0.009898479096591473, 0.009855511598289013, 0.00954272598028183, 0.008750146254897118, 0.007979950867593288, 0.007485857233405113, 0.0073218317702412605, 0.006777524016797543, 0.006546639371663332, 0.0064048804342746735]}",0.6354929804801941,Question Answering,0.00954272598028183

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Multimodal Neural Graph Memory Networks for Visual Question Answering,"We introduce a new neural network architecture, Multimodal Neural Graph Memory Networks (MN-GMN), for visual question answering. The MN-GMN uses graph structure with different region features as node attributes and applies a recently proposed powerful graph neural network model, Graph Network (GN), to reason about objects and their interactions in an image. The input module of the MN-GMN generates a set of visual features plus a set of encoded region-grounded captions (RGCs) for the image. The RGCs capture object attributes and their relationships. Two GNs are constructed from the input module using the visual features and encoded RGCs. Each node of the GNs iteratively computes a questionguided contextualized representation of the visual/textual information assigned to it. Then, to combine the information from both GNs, the nodes write the updated representations to an external spatial memory. The final states of the memory cells are fed into an answer module to predict an answer. Experiments show MN-GMN rivals the state-of-the-art models on Visual7W, VQA-v2.0, and CLEVR datasets.","{'sequence': 'We introduce a new neural network architecture, Multimodal Neural Graph Memory Networks (MN-GMN), for visual question answering.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Learning Web-based Procedures by Reasoning over Explanations and Demonstrations in Context,"We explore learning web-based tasks from a human teacher through natural language explanations and a single demonstration. Our approach investigates a new direction for semantic parsing that models explaining a demonstration in a context, rather than mapping explanations to demonstrations. By leveraging the idea of inverse semantics from program synthesis to reason backwards from observed demonstrations, we ensure that all considered interpretations are consistent with executable actions in any context, thus simplifying the problem of search over logical forms. We present a dataset of explanations paired with demonstrations for web-based tasks. Our methods show better task completion rates than a supervised semantic parsing baseline (40% relative improvement on average), and are competitive with simple exploration-anddemonstration based methods, while requiring no exploration of the environment. In learning to align explanations with demonstrations, basic properties of natural language syntax emerge as learned behavior.

The results show a dramatic improvement in the consistency and quality of the generated captions with respect to information needs specified via coherence relations.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07334979623556137, 0.07115492224693298, 0.07103119790554047, 0.07055939733982086, 0.06071518734097481, 0.06041652709245682, 0.058653708547353745, 0.05149517208337784, 0.0480603463947773, 0.04596557840704918, 0.04373485594987869, 0.042739324271678925, 0.03834373131394386, 0.037011679261922836, 0.035592857748270035, 0.03465220704674721, 0.03102766163647175, 0.024246132001280785, 0.023958878591656685, 0.02302304096519947, 0.020462317392230034, 0.01742139272391796, 0.016384107992053032]}",0.07334979623556137,Question Answering,0.020462317392230034
"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Cross-media Structured Common Space for Multimedia Event Extraction,"We introduce a new task, MultiMedia Event Extraction (M 2 E 2 ), which aims to extract events and their arguments from multimedia documents. We develop the first benchmark and collect a dataset of 245 multimedia news articles with extensively annotated events and arguments. 1 We propose a novel method, Weakly Aligned Structured Embedding (WASE), that encodes structured representations of semantic information from textual and visual data into a common embedding space. The structures are aligned across modalities by employing a weakly supervised training strategy, which enables exploiting available resources without explicit cross-media annotation. Compared to unimodal state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves 4.0% and 9.8% absolute F-score gains on text event argument role labeling and visual event extraction. Compared to stateof-the-art multimedia unstructured representations, we achieve 8.3% and 5.0% absolute Fscore gains on multimedia event extraction and argument role labeling, respectively.

Machine Learning for NLP,Generalizing Natural Language Analysis through Span-relation Representations,"Natural language processing covers a wide variety of tasks predicting syntax, semantics, and information content, and usually each type of output is generated with specially designed architectures. In this paper, we provide the simple insight that a great variety of tasks can be represented in a single unified format consisting of labeling spans and relations between spans, thus a single task-independent model can be used across different tasks. We perform extensive experiments to test this insight on 10 disparate tasks spanning dependency parsing (syntax), semantic role labeling (semantics), relation extraction (information content), aspect based sentiment analysis (sentiment), and many others, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized models. We further demonstrate benefits of multi-task learning, and also show that the proposed method makes it easy to analyze differences and similarities in how the model handles different tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Mixture of h - 1 Heads is Better than h Heads,"Multi-head attentive neural architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks. Evidence has shown that they are overparameterized; attention heads can be pruned without significant performance loss. In this work, we instead ""reallocate"" them-the model learns to activate different heads on different inputs. Drawing connections between multi-head attention and mixture of experts, we propose the mixture of attentive experts model (MAE). MAE is trained using a block coordinate descent algorithm that alternates between updating (1) the responsibilities of the experts and (2) their parameters. Experiments on machine translation and language modeling show that MAE outperforms strong baselines on both tasks. Particularly, on the WMT14 English to German translation dataset, MAE improves over ""transformer-base"" by 0.8 BLEU, with a comparable number of parameters. Our analysis shows that our model learns to specialize different experts to different inputs. 1","{'sequence': 'Multi-head attentive neural architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Pre-training Is (Almost) All You Need: An Application to Commonsense Reasoning,"Fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models has become the standard approach for solving common NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) . Most of the existing approaches rely on a randomly initialized classifier on top of such networks. We argue that this fine-tuning procedure is sub-optimal as the pre-trained model has no prior on the specific classifier labels, while it might have already learned an intrinsic textual representation of the task. In this paper, we introduce a new scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training phase. We study commonsense reasoning tasks where the model must rank a set of hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA (Gordon et al., 2012) , Swag (Zellers et al., 2018), HellaSwag  (Zellers et al., 2019)  and CommonsenseQA  (Talmor et al., 2019)  datasets. By exploiting our scoring method without fine-tuning, we are able to produce strong baselines (e.g. 80% test accuracy on COPA) that are comparable to supervised approaches. Moreover, when fine-tuning directly on the proposed scoring function, we show that our method provides a much more stable training phase across random restarts (e.g ×10 standard deviation reduction on COPA test accuracy) and requires less annotated data than the standard classifier approach to reach equivalent performances.","{'sequence': 'Fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models has become the standard approach for solving common NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) .

Machine Learning for NLP,On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond,"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) combine latent variables with amortized variational inference, whose optimization usually converges into a trivial local optimum termed posterior collapse, especially in text modeling. By tracking the optimization dynamics, we observe the encoder-decoder incompatibility that leads to poor parameterizations of the data manifold. We argue that the trivial local optimum may be avoided by improving the encoder and decoder parameterizations since the posterior network is part of a transition map between them. To this end, we propose Coupled-VAE, which couples a VAE model with a deterministic autoencoder with the same structure and improves the encoder and decoder parameterizations via encoder weight sharing and decoder signal matching. We apply the proposed Coupled-VAE approach to various VAE models with different regularization, posterior family, decoder structure, and optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo) show consistently improved results in terms of probability estimation and richness of the latent space.

Machine Learning for NLP,Masked Language Model Scoring,"Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) require finetuning for most NLP tasks.

By rescoring ASR and NMT hypotheses, RoBERTa reduces an endto-end LibriSpeech model's WER by 30% relative and adds up to +1.7 BLEU on state-of-theart baselines for low-resource translation pairs, with further gains from domain adaptation. We attribute this success to PLL's unsupervised expression of linguistic acceptability without a left-to-right bias, greatly improving on scores from GPT-2 (+10 points on island effects, NPI licensing in BLiMP). One can finetune MLMs to give scores without masking, enabling computation in a single inference pass. In all, PLLs and their associated pseudo-perplexities (PP-PLs) enable plug-and-play use of the growing number of pretrained MLMs; e.g., we use a single cross-lingual model to rescore translations in multiple languages.

One can finetune MLMs to give scores without masking, enabling computation in a single inference pass. In all, PLLs and their associated pseudo-perplexities (PP-PLs) enable plug-and-play use of the growing number of pretrained MLMs; e.g., we use a single cross-lingual model to rescore translations in multiple languages.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Batch Normalized Inference Network Keeps the KL Vanishing Away,"Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is widely used as a generative model to approximate a model's posterior on latent variables by combining the amortized variational inference and deep neural networks. However, when paired with strong autoregressive decoders, VAE often converges to a degenerated local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"". Previous approaches consider the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) individual for each datapoint. We propose to let the KL follow a distribution across the whole dataset, and analyze that it is sufficient to prevent posterior collapse by keeping the expectation of the KL's distribution positive. Then we propose Batch Normalized-VAE (BN-VAE), a simple but effective approach to set a lower bound of the expectation by regularizing the distribution of the approximate posterior's parameters. Without introducing any new model component or modifying the objective, our approach can avoid the posterior collapse effectively and efficiently.

Machine Learning for NLP,Improving Transformer Models by Reordering their Sublayers,"Multilayer transformer networks consist of interleaved self-attention and feedforward sublayers. Could ordering the sublayers in a different pattern lead to better performance? We generate randomly ordered transformers and train them with the language modeling objective. We observe that some of these models are able to achieve better performance than the interleaved baseline, and that those successful variants tend to have more self-attention at the bottom and more feedforward sublayers at the top. We propose a new transformer pattern that adheres to this property, the sandwich transformer, and show that it improves perplexity on multiple word-level and character-level language modeling benchmarks, at no cost in parameters, memory, or training time. However, the sandwich reordering pattern does not guarantee performance gains across every task, as we demonstrate on machine translation models. Instead, we suggest that further exploration of task-specific sublayer reorderings is needed in order to unlock additional gains. 1","{'sequence': 'Multilayer transformer networks consist of interleaved self-attention and feedforward sublayers.

Machine Learning for NLP,Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms for Text Representation,"Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models. In conventional pooling methods such as average, max and attentive pooling, text representations are weighted summations of the L 1 or L ∞ norm of input features. However, their pooling norms are always fixed and may not be optimal for learning accurate text representations in different tasks. In addition, in many popular pooling methods such as max and attentive pooling some features may be over-emphasized, while other useful ones are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms (APLN) approach for text representation. Different from existing pooling methods that use a fixed pooling norm, we propose to learn the norm in an end-to-end manner to automatically find the optimal ones for text representation in different tasks. In addition, we propose two methods to ensure the numerical stability of the model training. The first one is scale limiting, which re-scales the input to ensure non-negativity and alleviate the risk of exponential explosion. The second one is re-formulation, which decomposes the exponent operation to avoid computing the realvalued powers of the input and further accelerate the pooling operation. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of attentive pooling.","{'sequence': 'Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models.

Our findings indicate that MLM-based models might reach a diminishing return point as the supervised data size increases significantly.', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.41894879937171936, 0.11587236076593399, 0.050836872309446335, 0.04503384605050087, 0.043397337198257446, 0.03743865340948105, 0.03243408724665642, 0.026294471696019173, 0.025061337277293205, 0.021917829290032387, 0.021878037601709366, 0.021691085770726204, 0.018852997571229935, 0.017462555319070816, 0.014663812704384327, 0.013166865333914757, 0.01243586651980877, 0.01198288518935442, 0.011804915964603424, 0.011366927064955235, 0.010984890162944794, 0.010635152459144592, 0.005838385783135891]}",0.41894879937171936,Machine Learning for NLP,0.41894879937171936
Machine Learning for NLP,Calibrating Structured Output Predictors for Natural Language Processing,"We address the problem of calibrating prediction confidence for output entities of interest in natural language processing (NLP) applications. It is important that NLP applications such as named entity recognition and question answering produce calibrated confidence scores for their predictions, especially if the applications are to be deployed in a safetycritical domain such as healthcare. However, the output space of such structured prediction models is often too large to adapt binary or multi-class calibration methods directly. In this study, we propose a general calibration scheme for output entities of interest in neural network based structured prediction models. Our proposed method can be used with any binary class calibration scheme and a neural network model. Additionally, we show that our calibration method can also be used as an uncertainty-aware, entity-specific decoding step to improve the performance of the underlying model at no additional training cost or data requirements. We show that our method outperforms current calibration techniques for named-entity-recognition, part-ofspeech and question answering. We also improve our model's performance from our decoding step across several tasks and benchmark datasets. Our method improves the calibration and model performance on out-ofdomain test scenarios as well.","{'sequence': ""We address the problem of calibrating prediction confidence for output entities of interest in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

Machine Learning for NLP,Orthogonal Relation Transforms with Graph Context Modeling for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Distance-based knowledge graph embeddings have shown substantial improvement on the knowledge graph link prediction task, from TransE to the latest state-of-the-art RotatE. However, complex relations such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N still remain challenging to predict. In this work, we propose a novel distance-based approach for knowledge graph link prediction. First we extend the RotatE from 2D complex domain to high dimensional space with orthogonal transforms to model relations. The orthogonal transform embedding for relations keeps the capability for modeling symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse and compositional relations while achieves better modeling capacity. Second, the graph context is integrated into distance scoring functions directly. Specifically, graph context is explicitly modeled via two directed context representations. Each node embedding in knowledge graph is augmented with two context representations, which are computed from the neighboring outgoing and incoming nodes/edges respectively. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy on the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases. Our experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two common benchmarks FB15k-237 and WNRR-18, especially on FB15k-237 which has many high in-degree nodes.

Machine Learning for NLP,Robust Encodings: A Framework for Combating Adversarial Typos,"Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs. Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.","{'sequence': 'Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs.

Experimental results on the Penn Treebank and Chinese Treebank datasets show that when ground truth parse trees are provided as additional training signals, the model is able to achieve lower perplexity and induce trees with better quality.', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'NLP Applications', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.15315461158752441, 0.08134905248880386, 0.07916662842035294, 0.06140586733818054, 0.05520740896463394, 0.054594747722148895, 0.046894144266843796, 0.04228269308805466, 0.042169079184532166, 0.04172665625810623, 0.03726654127240181, 0.03637947514653206, 0.0355704165995121, 0.03488897159695625, 0.03478650003671646, 0.03034309111535549, 0.02650279738008976, 0.024237118661403656, 0.022134069353342056, 0.02165079675614834, 0.018664799630641937, 0.011334235779941082, 0.00829033087939024]}",0.15315461158752441,Speech and Multimodality,0.0355704165995121
Machine Learning for NLP,Taxonomy Construction of Unseen Domains via Graph-based Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer,"Extracting lexico-semantic relations as graphstructured taxonomies, also known as taxonomy construction, has been beneficial in a variety of NLP applications. Recently Graph Neural Network (GNN) has shown to be powerful in successfully tackling many tasks. However, there has been no attempt to exploit GNN to create taxonomies. In this paper, we propose Graph2Taxo, a GNN-based cross-domain transfer framework for the taxonomy construction task. Our main contribution is to learn the latent features of taxonomy construction from existing domains to guide the structure learning of an unseen domain. We also propose a novel method of directed acyclic graph (DAG) generation for taxonomy construction. Specifically, our proposed Graph2Taxo uses a noisy graph constructed from automatically extracted noisy hyponym-hypernym candidate pairs, and a set of taxonomies for some known domains for training. The learned model is then used to generate taxonomy for a new unknown domain given a set of terms for that domain. Experiments on benchmark datasets from science and environment domains show that our approach attains significant improvements correspondingly over the state of the art.","{'sequence': 'Extracting lexico-semantic relations as graphstructured taxonomies, also known as taxonomy construction, has been beneficial in a variety of NLP applications.

Machine Learning for NLP,Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn lowdimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space.

In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean-and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attentionbased transformations generalize to multiple relations.

In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10. * Work partially done during an internship at Google.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'NLP Applications', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.0705319419503212, 0.0665171667933464, 0.06574534624814987, 0.059386592358350754, 0.057845622301101685, 0.055920686572790146, 0.052952058613300323, 0.04916466027498245, 0.04539981484413147, 0.04458394646644592, 0.04446077346801758, 0.04057545214891434, 0.039488039910793304, 0.036571159958839417, 0.03607042133808136, 0.035580508410930634, 0.03527066484093666, 0.030039474368095398, 0.02854214794933796, 0.02838367410004139, 0.02732262946665287, 0.025179417803883553, 0.024467844516038895]}",0.0705319419503212,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.02732262946665287
Machine Learning for NLP,The Right Tool for the Job: Matching Model and Instance Complexities,"As NLP models become larger, executing a trained model requires significant computational resources incurring monetary and environmental costs. To better respect a given inference budget, we propose a modification to contextual representation fine-tuning which, during inference, allows for an early (and fast) ""exit"" from neural network calculations for simple instances, and late (and accurate) exit for hard instances. To achieve this, we add classifiers to different layers of BERT and use their calibrated confidence scores to make early exit decisions. We test our proposed modification on five different datasets in two tasks: three text classification datasets and two natural language inference benchmarks. Our method presents a favorable speed/accuracy tradeoff in almost all cases, producing models which are up to five times faster than the state of the art, while preserving their accuracy. Our method also requires almost no additional training resources (in either time or parameters) compared to the baseline BERT model. Finally, our method alleviates the need for costly retraining of multiple models at different levels of efficiency; we allow users to control the inference speed/accuracy tradeoff using a single trained model, by setting a single variable at inference time. We publicly release our code. 1 * Research completed during an internship at AI2.","{'sequence': 'As NLP models become larger, executing a trained model requires significant computational resources incurring monetary and environmental costs.

Machine Learning for NLP,Generalized Entropy Regularization or: There's Nothing Special about Label Smoothing,"Prior work has explored directly regularizing the output distributions of probabilistic models to alleviate peaky (i.e. over-confident) predictions, a common sign of overfitting. This class of techniques, of which label smoothing is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and datasets in language generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a trained model and its performance on language generation tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparse distributions, an undesirable property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place.

Machine Learning for NLP,SAFER: A Structure-free Approach for Certified Robustness to Adversarial Word Substitutions,"State-of-the-art NLP models can often be fooled by human-unaware transformations such as synonymous word substitution. For security reasons, it is of critical importance to develop models with certified robustness that can provably guarantee that the prediction is can not be altered by any possible synonymous word substitution. In this work, we propose a certified robust method based on a new randomized smoothing technique, which constructs a stochastic ensemble by applying random word substitutions on the input sentences, and leverage the statistical properties of the ensemble to provably certify the robustness. Our method is simple and structure-free in that it only requires the black-box queries of the model outputs, and hence can be applied to any pre-trained models (such as BERT) and any types of models (world-level or subwordlevel). Our method significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods for certified robustness on both IMDB and Amazon text classification tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Learning to Contextually Aggregate Multi-Source Supervision for Sequence Labeling,"Sequence labeling is a fundamental task for a range of natural language processing problems. When used in practice, its performance is largely influenced by the annotation quality and quantity, and meanwhile, obtaining ground truth labels is often costly.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework Consensus Network (CONNET) that can be trained on annotations from multiple sources (e.g., crowd annotation, cross-domain data). It learns individual representation for every source and dynamically aggregates source-specific knowledge by a context-aware attention module. Finally, it leads to a model reflecting the agreement (consensus) among multiple sources.

Machine Learning for NLP,Posterior Control of Blackbox Generation,"Text generation often requires high-precision output that obeys task-specific rules. This fine-grained control is difficult to enforce with off-the-shelf deep learning models. In this work, we consider augmenting neural generation models with discrete control states learned through a structured latent-variable approach. Under this formulation, task-specific knowledge can be encoded through a range of rich, posterior constraints that are effectively trained into the model.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Probabilistic Generative Model for Typographical Analysis of Early Modern Printing,"We propose a deep and interpretable probabilistic generative model to analyze glyph shapes in printed Early Modern documents. We focus on clustering extracted glyph images into underlying templates in the presence of multiple confounding sources of variance. Our approach introduces a neural editor model that first generates well-understood printing phenomena like spatial perturbations from template parameters via interpertable latent variables, and then modifies the result by generating a non-interpretable latent vector responsible for inking variations, jitter, noise from the archiving process, and other unforeseen phenomena associated with Early Modern printing. Critically, by introducing an inference network whose input is restricted to the visual residual between the observation and the interpretably-modified template, we are able to control and isolate what the vector-valued latent variable captures. We show that our approach outperforms rigid interpretable clustering baselines (Ocular) and overly-flexible deep generative models (VAE) alike on the task of completely unsupervised discovery of typefaces in mixed-font documents.","{'sequence': 'We propose a deep and interpretable probabilistic generative model to analyze glyph shapes in printed Early Modern documents.

Machine Learning for NLP,GAN-BERT: Generative Adversarial Learning for Robust Text Classification with a Bunch of Labeled Examples,"Recent Transformer-based architectures, e.g., BERT, provide impressive results in many Natural Language Processing tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Weight Poisoning Attacks on Pretrained Models,"Recently, NLP has seen a surge in the usage of large pre-trained models. Users download weights of models pre-trained on large datasets, then fine-tune the weights on a task of their choice. This raises the question of whether downloading untrusted pre-trained weights can pose a security threat. In this paper, we show that it is possible to construct ""weight poisoning"" attacks where pre-trained weights are injected with vulnerabilities that expose ""backdoors"" after fine-tuning, enabling the attacker to manipulate the model prediction simply by injecting an arbitrary keyword. We show that by applying a regularization method, which we call RIPPLe, and an initialization procedure, which we call Embedding Surgery, such attacks are possible even with limited knowledge of the dataset and finetuning procedure. Our experiments on sentiment classification, toxicity detection, and spam detection show that this attack is widely applicable and poses a serious threat.

We apply LEAQI to three sequence labeling tasks, demonstrating significantly fewer queries to the expert and comparable (or better) accuracies over a passive approach.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality'], 'scores': [0.07646775990724564, 0.0673849955201149, 0.05650145560503006, 0.05346265062689781, 0.05259057506918907, 0.05191944167017937, 0.05163225531578064, 0.04955470934510231, 0.04898524284362793, 0.047464560717344284, 0.04718278720974922, 0.046845726668834686, 0.04433624818921089, 0.03914088383316994, 0.0378081388771534, 0.03327096626162529, 0.031900785863399506, 0.03112662583589554, 0.030481155961751938, 0.028955889865756035, 0.02865934744477272, 0.023616120219230652, 0.020711762830615044]}",0.07646775990724564,Question Answering,0.047464560717344284
Machine Learning for NLP,Highway Transformer: Self-Gating Enhanced Self-Attentive Networks,"Self-attention mechanisms have made striking state-of-the-art (SOTA) progress in various sequence learning tasks, standing on the multiheaded dot product attention by attending to all the global contexts at different locations.

The subsidiary content-based SDU gates allow for the information flow of modulated latent embeddings through skipped connections, leading to a clear margin of convergence speed with gradient descent algorithms.

Machine Learning for NLP,SMART: Robust and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-trained Natural Language Models through Principled Regularized Optimization,"Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we propose a new learning framework for robust and efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained models to attain better generalization performance. The proposed framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the complexity of the model; 2. Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trustregion methods and can prevent aggressive updating. Our experiments show that the proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks including GLUE, SNLI, SciTail and ANLI. Moreover, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art T5 model, which is the largest pre-trained model containing 11 billion parameters, on GLUE. 1 * Work was done during an internship at Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI.","{'sequence': 'Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP).

Machine Learning for NLP,Why Overfitting Isn't Always Bad: Retrofitting Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings to Dictionaries,"Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy. We also retrofit to both the training dictionary and a synthetic dictionary induced from CLWE, which sometimes generalizes even better on downstream tasks. Our results confirm the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary in downstream tasks and explains why BLI is a flawed CLWE evaluation.","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI).

This study opens up avenues for exploiting inexpensive self-supervision to achieve performance gain in commonsense reasoning tasks. 1', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation'], 'scores': [0.11394311487674713, 0.08860211819410324, 0.07857157289981842, 0.06269042938947678, 0.05785094574093819, 0.049979548901319504, 0.04984020069241524, 0.04880167543888092, 0.0433841198682785, 0.04239474609494209, 0.03726045414805412, 0.037005048245191574, 0.03548625484108925, 0.031735487282276154, 0.030892018228769302, 0.030550232157111168, 0.02914888598024845, 0.02822839468717575, 0.02431061863899231, 0.022370105609297752, 0.021037332713603973, 0.018109135329723358, 0.01780756376683712]}",0.11394311487674713,Machine Learning for NLP,0.11394311487674713
Machine Learning for NLP,Span Selection Pre-training for Question Answering,"BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and related pre-trained Transformers have provided large gains across many language understanding tasks, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). BERT is pretrained on two auxiliary tasks: Masked Language Model and Next Sentence Prediction. In this paper we introduce a new pre-training task inspired by reading comprehension to better align the pre-training from memorization to understanding. Span Selection Pre-Training (SSPT) poses cloze-like training instances, but rather than draw the answer from the model's parameters, it is selected from a relevant passage. We find significant and consistent improvements over both BERT BASE and BERT LARGE on multiple Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) datasets. Specifically, our proposed model has strong empirical evidence as it obtains SOTA results on Natural Questions, a new benchmark MRC dataset, outperforming BERT LARGE by 3 F1 points on short answer prediction. We also show significant impact in HotpotQA, improving answer prediction F1 by 4 points and supporting fact prediction F1 by 1 point and outperforming the previous best system. Moreover, we show that our pre-training approach is particularly effective when training data is limited, improving the learning curve by a large amount.","{'sequence': ""BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and related pre-trained Transformers have provided large gains across many language understanding tasks, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Machine Learning for NLP,MobileBERT: a Compact Task-Agnostic BERT for Resource-Limited Devices,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However, these models suffer from heavy model sizes and high latency such that they cannot be deployed to resourcelimited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model. Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be generically applied to various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning. Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT LARGE , while equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an invertedbottleneck incorporated BERT LARGE model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is 4.3× smaller and 5.5× faster than BERT BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUE score of 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT BASE ), and 62 ms latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of 90.0/79.2 (1.5/2.1 higher than BERT BASE ).","{'sequence': 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Machine Learning for NLP,Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Neural Network-based Dependency Parsing Models with Adversarial Examples,"Despite achieving prominent performance on many important tasks, it has been reported that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previously studies along this line mainly focused on semantic tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering and reading comprehension. In this study, we show that adversarial examples also exist in dependency parsing: we propose two approaches to study where and how parsers make mistakes by searching over perturbations to existing texts at sentence and phrase levels, and design algorithms to construct such examples in both of the black-box and white-box settings. Our experiments with one of state-of-the-art parsers on the English Penn Treebank (PTB) show that up to 77% of input examples admit adversarial perturbations, and we also show that the robustness of parsing models can be improved by crafting high-quality adversaries and including them in the training stage, while suffering little to no performance drop on the clean input data.","{'sequence': 'Despite achieving prominent performance on many important tasks, it has been reported that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Machine Learning for NLP,Posterior Calibrated Training on Sentence Classification Tasks,"Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability. In many settings however, the quality of posterior probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and empirical posterior probabilities. We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization term. Also, PosCal has the advantage that it incrementally tracks needed statistics for the calibration objective during the training process, making efficient use of large training sets 1 .","{'sequence': 'Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability.

Additionally, our methods take tokens and their labels into account, which is more robust than only using either of them as an information source, as conducted in prior work.

Recently, semantic dependency tree implemented by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is introduced to describe the inner connection between aspects and the associated emotion words. But the improvement is limited due to the noise and instability of dependency trees. To this end, we propose a dependency graph enhanced dual-transformer network (named DGEDT) by jointly considering the flat representations learnt from Transformer and graphbased representations learnt from the corresponding dependency graph in an iterative interaction manner. Specifically, a dualtransformer structure is devised in DGEDT to support mutual reinforcement between the flat representation learning and graph-based representation learning. The idea is to allow the dependency graph to guide the representation learning of the transformer encoder and vice versa. The results on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGEDT outperforms all state-of-the-art alternatives with a large margin.","{'sequence': 'Aspect-based sentiment classification is a popular task aimed at identifying the corresponding emotion of a specific aspect.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Relational Memory-based Embedding Model for Triple Classification and Search Personalization,"Knowledge graph embedding methods often suffer from a limitation of memorizing valid triples to predict new ones for triple classification and search personalization problems. To this end, we introduce a novel embedding model, named R-MeN, that explores a relational memory network to encode potential dependencies in relationship triples. R-MeN considers each triple as a sequence of 3 input vectors that recurrently interact with a memory using a transformer self-attention mechanism. Thus R-MeN encodes new information from interactions between the memory and each input vector to return a corresponding vector. Consequently, R-MeN feeds these 3 returned vectors to a convolutional neural network-based decoder to produce a scalar score for the triple. Experimental results show that our proposed R-MeN obtains state-of-theart results on SEARCH17 for the search personalization task, and on WN11 and FB13 for the triple classification task.","{'sequence': 'Knowledge graph embedding methods often suffer from a limitation of memorizing valid triples to predict new ones for triple classification and search personalization problems.

Machine Learning for NLP,SEEK: Segmented Embedding of Knowledge Graphs,"In recent years, knowledge graph embedding becomes a pretty hot research topic of artificial intelligence and plays increasingly vital roles in various downstream applications, such as recommendation and question answering. However, existing methods for knowledge graph embedding can not make a proper trade-off between the model complexity and the model expressiveness, which makes them still far from satisfactory. To mitigate this problem, we propose a lightweight modeling framework that can achieve highly competitive relational expressiveness without increasing the model complexity. Our framework focuses on the design of scoring functions and highlights two critical characteristics: 1) facilitating sufficient feature interactions; 2) preserving both symmetry and antisymmetry properties of relations. It is noteworthy that owing to the general and elegant design of scoring functions, our framework can incorporate many famous existing methods as special cases. Moreover, extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.

On the discourse representation benchmark DiscoEval, our model improves over the previous state-of-the-art by up to 13% and on average 4% absolute across 7 tasks. Our model is the same size as BERT-Base, but outperforms the much larger BERT-Large model and other more recent approaches that incorporate discourse.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Addressing Posterior Collapse with Mutual Information for Improved Variational Neural Machine Translation,"This paper proposes a simple and effective approach to address the problem of posterior collapse in conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). It thus improves performance of machine translation models that use noisy or monolingual data, as well as in conventional settings. Extending Transformer and conditional VAEs, our proposed latent variable model measurably prevents posterior collapse by (1) using a modified evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective which promotes mutual information between the latent variable and the target, and (2) guiding the latent variable with an auxiliary bag-of-words prediction task. As a result, the proposed model yields improved translation quality compared to existing variational NMT models on WMT Ro↔En and De↔En. With latent variables being effectively utilized, our model demonstrates improved robustness over non-latent Transformer in handling uncertainty: exploiting noisy source-side monolingual data (up to +3.2 BLEU), and training with weakly aligned web-mined parallel data (up to +4.7 BLEU).","{'sequence': 'This paper proposes a simple and effective approach to address the problem of posterior collapse in conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs).

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Unsupervised Word Translation with Adversarial Autoencoder,"Crosslingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning crosslingual embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this article, we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with high-and low-resource languages from two different data sets show that our method achieves better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system.

On distant language pairs that are hard for unsupervised MT to perform well, AT performs remarkably better, achieving performances comparable to supervised SMT trained on more than 4M parallel sentences 1 .', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1607004851102829, 0.09099166095256805, 0.07273930311203003, 0.0720343068242073, 0.05572112649679184, 0.04892214760184288, 0.040301546454429626, 0.03828160837292671, 0.03530285879969597, 0.03488356992602348, 0.03369322791695595, 0.03194544464349747, 0.03176668658852577, 0.030707279220223427, 0.03031744249165058, 0.02999834343791008, 0.02682412974536419, 0.02558189257979393, 0.025222476571798325, 0.024891987442970276, 0.023454919457435608, 0.021355846896767616, 0.01436182577162981]}",0.1607004851102829,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.1607004851102829
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Using Context in Neural Machine Translation Training Objectives,"We present Neural Machine Translation (NMT) training using document-level metrics with batch-level documents. Previous sequence-objective approaches to NMT training focus exclusively on sentence-level metrics like sentence BLEU which do not correspond to the desired evaluation metric, typically document BLEU. Meanwhile research into document-level NMT training focuses on data or model architecture rather than training procedure. We find that each of these lines of research has a clear space in it for the other, and propose merging them with a scheme that allows a document-level evaluation metric to be used in the NMT training objective. We first sample pseudo-documents from sentence samples. We then approximate the expected document BLEU gradient with Monte Carlo sampling for use as a cost function in Minimum Risk Training (MRT). This twolevel sampling procedure gives NMT performance gains over sequence MRT and maximum-likelihood training. We demonstrate that training is more robust for document-level metrics than with sequence metrics. We further demonstrate improvements on NMT with TER and Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) using GLEU, both metrics used at the document level for evaluations.","{'sequence': 'We present Neural Machine Translation (NMT) training using document-level metrics with batch-level documents.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction,"Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages. Recent methods are mostly based on unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings, the key to which is to find initial solutions of word translations, followed by the learning and refinement of mappings between the embedding spaces of two languages. However, previous methods find initial solutions just based on word-level information, which may be (1) limited and inaccurate, and (2) prone to contain some noise introduced by the insufficiently pre-trained embeddings of some words. To deal with those issues, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based paradigm to induce bilingual lexicons in a coarse-to-fine way. We first build a graph for each language with its vertices representing different words. Then we extract word cliques from the graphs and map the cliques of two languages. Based on that, we induce the initial word translation solution with the central words of the aligned cliques. This coarse-to-fine approach not only leverages clique-level information, which is richer and more accurate, but also effectively reduces the bad effect of the noise in the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we take the initial solution as the seed to learn cross-lingual embeddings, from which we induce bilingual lexicons. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction compared with previous methods.","{'sequence': 'Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamically Adjusting Transformer Batch Size by Monitoring Gradient Direction Change,"The choice of hyper-parameters affects the performance of neural models. While much previous research (Sutskever et al., 2013; Duchi et al., 2011; Kingma and Ba, 2015) focuses on accelerating convergence and reducing the effects of the learning rate, comparatively few papers concentrate on the effect of batch size. In this paper, we analyze how increasing batch size affects gradient direction, and propose to evaluate the stability of gradients with their angle change. Based on our observations, the angle change of gradient direction first tends to stabilize (i.e. gradually decrease) while accumulating mini-batches, and then starts to fluctuate. We propose to automatically and dynamically determine batch sizes by accumulating gradients of mini-batches and performing an optimization step at just the time when the direction of gradients starts to fluctuate. To improve the efficiency of our approach for large models, we propose a sampling approach to select gradients of parameters sensitive to the batch size. Our approach dynamically determines proper and efficient batch sizes during training. In our experiments on the WMT 14 English to German and English to French tasks, our approach improves the Transformer with a fixed 25k batch size by +0.73 and +0.82 BLEU respectively.","{'sequence': 'The choice of hyper-parameters affects the performance of neural models.

To improve the efficiency of our approach for large models, we propose a sampling approach to select gradients of parameters sensitive to the batch size. Our approach dynamically determines proper and efficient batch sizes during training. In our experiments on the WMT 14 English to German and English to French tasks, our approach improves the Transformer with a fixed 25k batch size by +0.73 and +0.82 BLEU respectively.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Extraction', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10250294953584671, 0.07793308794498444, 0.07602620869874954, 0.05886964872479439, 0.057989899069070816, 0.05775453895330429, 0.0576687753200531, 0.05042026564478874, 0.04880845174193382, 0.04828281328082085, 0.0450008362531662, 0.034502383321523666, 0.03082498535513878, 0.030054546892642975, 0.029340453445911407, 0.029265811666846275, 0.028432529419660568, 0.02806871570646763, 0.025059649720788002, 0.023878656327724457, 0.02137632481753826, 0.02051500417292118, 0.017423514276742935]}",0.10250294953584671,Resources and Evaluation,0.04828281328082085
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Systematic Study of Inner-Attention-Based Sentence Representations in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Neural machine translation has considerably improved the quality of automatic translations by learning good representations of input sentences. In this article, we explore a multilingual translation model capable of producing fixed-size sentence representations by incorporating an intermediate crosslingual shared layer, which we refer to as attention bridge. This layer exploits the semantics from each language and develops into a language-agnostic meaning representation that can be efficiently used for transfer learning. We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks. Similarly, we show that trainable downstream tasks benefit from multilingual models, whereas additional language signals do not improve performance in non-trainable benchmarks.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Norm-Based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation,"A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with highresource settings. As the NMT architectures become deeper and wider, this issue gets worse and worse. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of training an NMT by introducing a novel norm-based curriculum learning method. We use the norm (aka length or module) of a word embedding as a measure of 1) the difficulty of the sentence, 2) the competence of the model, and 3) the weight of the sentence. The normbased sentence difficulty takes the advantages of both linguistically motivated and modelbased sentence difficulties. It is easy to determine and contains learning-dependent features. The norm-based model competence makes NMT learn the curriculum in a fully automated way, while the norm-based sentence weight further enhances the learning of the vector representation of the NMT. Experimental results for the WMT'14 English-German and WMT'17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in terms of BLEU score (+1.17/+1.56) and training speedup (2.22x/3.33x).","{'sequence': ""A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with highresource settings.

Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size.

Previous research shows that even with residual connection and layer normalization, deep Transformers still have difficulty in training, and particularly Transformer models with more than 12 encoder/decoder layers fail to converge. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that a simple modification made in the official implementation, which changes the computation order of residual connection and layer normalization, can significantly ease the optimization of deep Transformers. We then compare the subtle differences in computation order in considerable detail, and present a parameter initialization method that leverages the Lipschitz constraint on the initialization of Transformer parameters that effectively ensures training convergence. In contrast to findings in previous research we further demonstrate that with Lipschitz parameter initialization, deep Transformers with the original computation order can converge, and obtain significant BLEU improvements with up to 24 layers. In contrast to previous research which focuses on deep encoders, our approach additionally enables Transformers to also benefit from deep decoders.","{'sequence': 'The Transformer translation model employs residual connection and layer normalization to ease the optimization difficulties caused by its multi-layer encoder/decoder structure.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Limitations of Cross-lingual Encoders as Exposed by Reference-Free Machine Translation Evaluation,"Evaluation of cross-lingual encoders is usually performed either via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in supervised downstream tasks or via unsupervised cross-lingual textual similarity. In this paper, we concern ourselves with reference-free machine translation (MT) evaluation where we directly compare source texts to (sometimes low-quality) system translations, which represents a natural adversarial setup for multilingual encoders. Referencefree evaluation holds the promise of web-scale comparison of MT systems. We systematically investigate a range of metrics based on state-of-the-art cross-lingual semantic representations obtained with pretrained M-BERT and LASER. We find that they perform poorly as semantic encoders for reference-free MT evaluation and identify their two key limitations, namely, (a) a semantic mismatch between representations of mutual translations and, more prominently, (b) the inability to punish ""translationese"", i.e., low-quality literal translations. We propose two partial remedies: (1) post-hoc re-alignment of the vector spaces and (2) coupling of semantic-similarity based metrics with target-side language modeling. In segment-level MT evaluation, our best metric surpasses reference-based BLEU by 5.7 correlation points.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamic Programming Encoding for Subword Segmentation in Neural Machine Translation,"This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units. We view the subword segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several WMT datasets including English ↔ (German, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian).","{'sequence': 'This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Evaluating Explanation Methods for Neural Machine Translation,"Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods. Word Alignment Error Rate can be used as such a metric that matches human understanding, however, it can not measure explanation methods on those target words that are not aligned to any source word. This paper thereby makes an initial attempt to evaluate explanation methods from an alternative viewpoint. To this end, it proposes a principled metric based on fidelity in regard to the predictive behavior of the NMT model. As the exact computation for this metric is intractable, we employ an efficient approach as its approximation. On six standard translation tasks, we quantitatively evaluate several explanation methods in terms of the proposed metric and we reveal some valuable findings for these explanation methods in our experiments.","{'sequence': 'Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Linguistic Representational Power of Neural Machine Translation Models,"Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing and other spheres of artificial intelligence, their interpretability remains a challenge.

(ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently?

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Reducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation Problem,"Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al., 2019) . Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a 'balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is 'catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a latticerescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al. (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of 'black box' online commercial MT systems. We demonstrate our approach translating from English into three languages with varied linguistic properties and data availability.","{'sequence': ""Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men.

Rather than attempt to create a 'balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is 'catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a latticerescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al. (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of 'black box' online commercial MT systems.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Inference Calibration of Neural Machine Translation,"Confidence calibration, which aims to make model predictions equal to the true correctness measures, is important for neural machine translation (NMT) because it is able to offer useful indicators of translation errors in the generated output. While prior studies have shown that NMT models trained with label smoothing are well-calibrated on the groundtruth training data, we find that miscalibration still remains a severe challenge for NMT during inference due to the discrepancy between training and inference. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, our work provides in-depth analyses of the correlation between calibration and translation performance as well as linguistic properties of miscalibration and reports a number of interesting findings that might help humans better analyze, understand and improve NMT models. Based on these observations, we further propose a new graduated label smoothing method that can improve both inference calibration and translation performance. 1 * Work was done when Shuo Wang was interning at Tencent AI Lab under the Rhino-Bird Elite Training Program.","{'sequence': 'Confidence calibration, which aims to make model predictions equal to the true correctness measures, is important for neural machine translation (NMT) because it is able to offer useful indicators of translation errors in the generated output.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Location Attention for Extrapolation to Longer Sequences,"Neural networks are surprisingly good at interpolating and perform remarkably well when the training set examples resemble those in the test set.

In this paper, we first review the notion of extrapolation, why it is important, and how one could hope to tackle it. We then focus on a specific type of extrapolation, which is especially useful for natural language processing: generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training. We hypothesize that models with a separate contentand location-based attention are more likely to extrapolate than those with common attention mechanisms. We empirically support our claim for recurrent seq2seq models with our proposed attention on variants of the Lookup Table task .

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Tagged Back-translation Revisited: Why Does It Really Work?,"In this paper, we show that neural machine translation (NMT) systems trained on large back-translated data overfit some of the characteristics of machine-translated texts. Such NMT systems better translate humanproduced translations, i.e., translationese, but may largely worsen the translation quality of original texts. Our analysis reveals that adding a simple tag to back-translations prevents this quality degradation and improves on average the overall translation quality by helping the NMT system to distinguish back-translated data from original parallel data during training. We also show that, in contrast to high-resource configurations, NMT systems trained in lowresource settings are much less vulnerable to overfit back-translations. We conclude that the back-translations in the training data should always be tagged especially when the origin of the text to be translated is unknown.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we show that neural machine translation (NMT) systems trained on large back-translated data overfit some of the characteristics of machine-translated texts.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Variational Neural Machine Translation with Normalizing Flows,"Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) is an attractive framework for modeling the generation of target translations, conditioned not only on the source sentence but also on some latent random variables. The latent variable modeling may introduce useful statistical dependencies that can improve translation accuracy. Unfortunately, learning informative latent variables is non-trivial, as the latent space can be prohibitively large, and the latent codes are prone to be ignored by many translation models at training time. Previous works impose strong assumptions on the distribution of the latent code and limit the choice of the NMT architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply the VNMT framework to the state-of-the-art Transformer and introduce a more flexible approximate posterior based on normalizing flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal under both in-domain and out-of-domain conditions, significantly outperforming strong baselines.","{'sequence': 'Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) is an attractive framework for modeling the generation of target translations, conditioned not only on the source sentence but also on some latent random variables.

Experiments on Chinese→English and German→English show that our adaptive policies can outperform fixed ones by up to 4 BLEU points for the same latency, and more surprisingly, it even surpasses the BLEU score of full-sentence translation in the greedy mode (and very close to beam mode), but with much lower latency.', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1398286521434784, 0.1260252147912979, 0.0782172828912735, 0.06356755644083023, 0.05163982883095741, 0.04985363408923149, 0.04521132633090019, 0.043620482087135315, 0.0433318130671978, 0.04011392593383789, 0.04003828763961792, 0.03917965292930603, 0.0369131863117218, 0.02633710764348507, 0.02614722214639187, 0.02388663962483406, 0.021386681124567986, 0.021134046837687492, 0.019258443266153336, 0.019163239747285843, 0.01913359947502613, 0.017510518431663513, 0.008501657284796238]}",0.1398286521434784,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.1398286521434784
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Learning to Recover from Multi-Modality Errors for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) predicts the entire target sequence simultaneously and significantly accelerates inference process. However, NAT discards the dependency information in a sentence, and thus inevitably suffers from the multi-modality problem: the target tokens may be provided by different possible translations, often causing token repetitions or missing. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel semiautoregressive model RecoverSAT in this work, which generates a translation as a sequence of segments. The segments are generated simultaneously while each segment is predicted token-by-token. By dynamically determining segment length and deleting repetitive segments, RecoverSAT is capable of recovering from repetitive and missing token errors. Experimental results on three widelyused benchmark datasets show that our proposed model achieves more than 4× speedup while maintaining comparable performance compared with the corresponding autoregressive model. * indicates equal contribution † indicates corresponding author Src. es gibt heute viele Farmer mit diesem Ansatz Feasible there are lots of farmers doing this today Trans. there are a lot of farmers doing this today Trans. 1 there are lots of of farmers doing this today Trans. 2 there are a lot farmers doing this today","{'sequence': 'Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) predicts the entire target sequence simultaneously and significantly accelerates inference process.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Multiscale Collaborative Deep Models for Neural Machine Translation,"Recent evidence reveals that Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models with deeper neural networks can be more effective but are difficult to train. In this paper, we present a MultiScale Collaborative (MSC) framework to ease the training of NMT models that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly boost the gradient backpropagation from top to bottom levels by introducing a block-scale collaboration mechanism into deep NMT models. Then, instead of forcing the whole encoder stack directly learns a desired representation, we let each encoder block learns a fine-grained representation and enhance it by encoding spatial dependencies using a context-scale collaboration. We provide empirical evidence showing that the MSC nets are easy to optimize and can obtain improvements of translation quality from considerably increased depth. On IWSLT translation tasks with three translation directions, our extremely deep models (with 72-layer encoders) surpass strong baselines by +2.2∼+3.1 BLEU points. In addition, our deep MSC achieves a BLEU score of 30.56 on WMT14 English→German task that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep NMT models.","{'sequence': 'Recent evidence reveals that Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models with deeper neural networks can be more effective but are difficult to train.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,BPE-Dropout: Simple and Effective Subword Regularization,"Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation. The dominant approach to subword segmentation is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which keeps the most frequent words intact while splitting the rare ones into multiple tokens. While multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary, BPE splits words into unique sequences; this may prevent a model from better learning the compositionality of words and being robust to segmentation errors. So far, the only way to overcome this BPE imperfection, its deterministic nature, was to create another subword segmentation algorithm (Kudo, 2018) . In contrast, we show that BPE itself incorporates the ability to produce multiple segmentations of the same word. We introduce BPE-dropout -simple and effective subword regularization method based on and compatible with conventional BPE. It stochastically corrupts the segmentation procedure of BPE, which leads to producing multiple segmentations within the same fixed BPE framework. Using BPE-dropout during training and the standard BPE during inference improves translation quality up to 2.3 BLEU compared to BPE and up to 0.9 BLEU compared to the previous subword regularization.","{'sequence': 'Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation.

This makes us rethink the real benefits of multi-encoder in context-aware translation -some of the improvements come from robust training. We compare several methods that introduce noise and/or well-tuned dropout setup into the training of these encoders.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Jointly Masked Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"The masked language model has received remarkable attention due to its effectiveness on various natural language processing tasks. However, few works have adopted this technique in the sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we introduce a jointly masked sequence-to-sequence model and explore its application on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). Specifically, we first empirically study the functionalities of the encoder and the decoder in NAT models, and find that the encoder takes a more important role than the decoder regarding the translation quality. Therefore, we propose to train the encoder more rigorously by masking the encoder input while training. As for the decoder, we propose to train it based on the consecutive masking of the decoder input with an ngram loss function to alleviate the problem of translating duplicate words. The two types of masks are applied to the model jointly at the training stage. We conduct experiments on five benchmark machine translation tasks, and our model can achieve 27.69/32.24 BLEU scores on WMT14 English-German/German-English tasks with 5+ times speed up compared with an autoregressive model.","{'sequence': 'The masked language model has received remarkable attention due to its effectiveness on various natural language processing tasks.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Gender in Danger? Evaluating Speech Translation Technology on the MuST-SHE Corpus,"Translating from languages without productive grammatical gender like English into gender-marked languages is a well-known difficulty for machines. This difficulty is also due to the fact that the training data on which models are built typically reflect the asymmetries of natural languages, gender bias included. Exclusively fed with textual data, machine translation is intrinsically constrained by the fact that the input sentence does not always contain clues about the gender identity of the referred human entities. But what happens with speech translation, where the input is an audio signal? Can audio provide additional information to reduce gender bias? We present the first thorough investigation of gender bias in speech translation, contributing with: i) the release of a benchmark useful for future studies, and ii) the comparison of different technologies (cascade and end-to-end) on two language directions (English-Italian/French).","{'sequence': 'Translating from languages without productive grammatical gender like English into gender-marked languages is a well-known difficulty for machines.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Novel Graph-based Multi-modal Fusion Encoder for Neural Machine Translation,"Multi-modal neural machine translation (NMT) aims to translate source sentences into a target language paired with images. However, dominant multi-modal NMT models do not fully exploit fine-grained semantic correspondences between semantic units of different modalities, which have potential to refine multi-modal representation learning. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based multi-modal fusion encoder for NMT. Specifically, we first represent the input sentence and image using a unified multi-modal graph, which captures various semantic relationships between multi-modal semantic units (words and visual objects). We then stack multiple graph-based multi-modal fusion layers that iteratively perform semantic interactions to learn node representations. Finally, these representations provide an attention-based context vector for the decoder. We evaluate our proposed encoder on the Multi30K datasets.

NLP Applications,Spelling Error Correction with Soft-Masked BERT,"Spelling error correction is an important yet challenging task because a satisfactory solution of it essentially needs human-level language understanding ability. Without loss of generality we consider Chinese spelling error correction (CSC) in this paper. A state-ofthe-art method for the task selects a character from a list of candidates for correction (including non-correction) at each position of the sentence on the basis of BERT, the language representation model. The accuracy of the method can be sub-optimal, however, because BERT does not have sufficient capability to detect whether there is an error at each position, apparently due to the way of pre-training it using mask language modeling. In this work, we propose a novel neural architecture to address the aforementioned issue, which consists of a network for error detection and a network for error correction based on BERT, with the former being connected to the latter with what we call soft-masking technique. Our method of using 'Soft-Masked BERT' is general, and it may be employed in other language detectioncorrection problems.

NLP Applications,Multi-Label and Multilingual News Framing Analysis,"News framing refers to the practice in which aspects of specific issues are highlighted in the news to promote a particular interpretation. In NLP, although recent works have studied framing in English news, few have studied how the analysis can be extended to other languages and in a multi-label setting. In this work, we explore multilingual transfer learning to detect multiple frames from just the news headline in a genuinely low-resource context where there are few/no frame annotations in the target language. We propose a novel method that can leverage elementary resources consisting of a dictionary and few annotations to detect frames in the target language. Our method performs comparably or better than translating the entire target language headline to the source language for which we have annotated data. This work opens up an exciting new capability of scaling up frame analysis to many languages, even those without existing translation technologies. Lastly, we apply our method to detect frames on the issue of U.S. gun violence in multiple languages and obtain exciting insights on the relationship between different frames of the same problem across different countries with different languages.","{'sequence': 'News framing refers to the practice in which aspects of specific issues are highlighted in the news to promote a particular interpretation.

NLP Applications,Clinical Concept Linking with Contextualized Neural Representations,"In traditional approaches to entity linking, linking decisions are based on three sources of information -the similarity of the mention string to an entity's name, the similarity of the context of the document to the entity, and broader information about the knowledge base (KB). In some domains, there is little contextual information present in the KB and thus we rely more heavily on mention string similarity. We consider one example of this, concept linking, which seeks to link mentions of medical concepts to a medical concept ontology. We propose an approach to concept linking that leverages recent work in contextualized neural models, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) , which create a token representation that integrates the surrounding context of the mention and concept name. We find a neural ranking approach paired with contextualized embeddings provides gains over a competitive baseline (Leaman et al., 2013) . Additionally, we find that a pre-training step using synonyms from the ontology offers a useful initialization for the ranker.","{'sequence': ""In traditional approaches to entity linking, linking decisions are based on three sources of information -the similarity of the mention string to an entity's name, the similarity of the context of the document to the entity, and broader information about the knowledge base (KB).

NLP Applications,Modeling Code-Switch Languages Using Bilingual Parallel Corpus,"Language modeling is the technique to estimate the probability of a sequence of words. A bilingual language model is expected to model the sequential dependency for words across languages, which is difficult due to the inherent lack of suitable training data as well as diverse syntactic structure across languages. We propose a bilingual attention language model (BALM) that simultaneously performs language modeling objective with a quasi-translation objective to model both the monolingual as well as the cross-lingual sequential dependency. The attention mechanism learns the bilingual context from a parallel corpus. BALM achieves state-of-theart performance on the SEAME code-switch database by reducing the perplexity of 20.5% over the best-reported result. We also apply BALM in bilingual lexicon induction, and language normalization tasks to validate the idea.","{'sequence': 'Language modeling is the technique to estimate the probability of a sequence of words.

NLP Applications,Empowering Active Learning to Jointly Optimize System and User Demands,"Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training. However, when active learning is integrated with an end-user application, this can lead to frustration for participating users, as they spend time labeling instances that they would not otherwise be interested in reading. In this paper, we propose a new active learning approach that jointly optimizes the seemingly counteracting objectives of the active learning system (training efficiently) and the user (receiving useful instances). We study our approach in an educational application, which particularly benefits from this technique as the system needs to rapidly learn to predict the appropriateness of an exercise to a particular user, while the users should receive only exercises that match their skills. We evaluate multiple learning strategies and user types with data from real users and find that our joint approach better satisfies both objectives when alternative methods lead to many unsuitable exercises for end users. 1","{'sequence': 'Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training.

NLP Applications,Hiring Now: A Skill-Aware Multi-Attention Model for Job Posting Generation,"Writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process, but the task is often more difficult than many people think. It is challenging to specify the level of education, experience, relevant skills per the company information and job description. To this end, we propose a novel task of Job Posting Generation (JPG) that is cast as a conditional text generation problem to generate job requirements according to the job descriptions. To deal with this task, we devise a data-driven global Skill-Aware Multi-Attention generation model, named SAMA. Specifically, to model the complex mapping relationships between input and output, we design a hierarchical decoder that we first label the job description with multiple skills, then we generate a complete text guided by the skill labels. At the same time, to exploit the prior knowledge about the skills, we further construct a skill knowledge graph to capture the global prior knowledge of skills and refine the generated results. The proposed approach is evaluated on real-world job posting data.

It is crucial in a considerable number of fields like humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge.

We evaluate our ranking approach in a simulation on difficult texts and show that it greatly outperforms a strong baseline in ranking accuracy.

NLP Applications,Improving Segmentation for Technical Support Problems,"Technical support problems are often long and complex. They typically contain user descriptions of the problem, the setup, and steps for attempted resolution. Often they also contain various non-natural language text elements like outputs of commands, snippets of code, error messages or stack traces. These elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. However, they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. We formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task, and study the performance of state of the art approaches. We compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline, and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. We also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources, which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. Finally, we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval.","{'sequence': 'Technical support problems are often long and complex.

We show that the existing authorship obfuscation methods are not stealthy as their obfuscated texts can be identified with an average F1 score of 0.87. The reason for the lack of stealthiness is that these obfuscators degrade text smoothness, as ascertained by neural language models, in a detectable manner.

Despite promising results, paraphrases generated by these models mostly suffer from lack of quality and diversity. To address these problems, we propose a novel retrieval-based method for paraphrase generation. Our model first retrieves a paraphrase pair similar to the input sentence from a pre-defined index. With its novel editor module, the model then paraphrases the input sequence by editing it using the extracted relations between the retrieved pair of sentences. In order to have fine-grained control over the editing process, our model uses the newly introduced concept of Micro Edit Vectors. It both extracts and exploits these vectors using the attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture.

Our model can encode high-order relationships into user and news representations by information propagation along the graph.

NLP Applications,Encoder-Decoder Models Can Benefit from Pre-trained Masked Language Models in Grammatical Error Correction,"This paper investigates how to effectively incorporate a pre-trained masked language model (MLM), such as BERT, into an encoderdecoder (EncDec) model for grammatical error correction (GEC).

Our experiments show that our proposed method, where we first fine-tune a MLM with a given GEC corpus and then use the output of the finetuned MLM as additional features in the GEC model, maximizes the benefit of the MLM.

NLP Applications,Fine-grained Interest Matching for Neural News Recommendation,"Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to improve users' online news reading experience. The core of news recommendation is accurate matching between user's interests and candidate news. The same user usually has diverse interests that are reflected in different news she has browsed.

Existing studies generally represent each user as a single vector and then match the candidate news vector, which may lose fine-grained information for recommendation. In this paper, we propose FIM, a Finegrained Interest Matching method for neural news recommendation. Instead of aggregating user's all historical browsed news into a unified vector, we hierarchically construct multilevel representations for each news via stacked dilated convolutions. Then we perform finegrained matching between segment pairs of each browsed news and the candidate news at each semantic level.

NLP Applications,Toxicity Detection: Does Context Really Matter?,"Moderation is crucial to promoting healthy online discussions. Although several 'toxicity' detection datasets and models have been published, most of them ignore the context of the posts, implicitly assuming that comments may be judged independently.

We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title. We find that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts. Moreover, a small but significant subset of manually labeled posts (5% in one of our experiments) end up having the opposite toxicity labels if the annotators are not provided with context. Surprisingly, we also find no evidence that context actually improves the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried a range of classifiers and mechanisms to make them context aware.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate active learning and semisupervised generative learning for text spam detection.', 'labels': ['Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1152433529496193, 0.07908844947814941, 0.07144865393638611, 0.06200734153389931, 0.05719190835952759, 0.051515430212020874, 0.04750907048583031, 0.04506709426641464, 0.04214201122522354, 0.04096422344446182, 0.03929519280791283, 0.03710229694843292, 0.036748241633176804, 0.035625021904706955, 0.035454850643873215, 0.0352538600564003, 0.030506568029522896, 0.030018769204616547, 0.02497628889977932, 0.02481655217707157, 0.023464344441890717, 0.020355641841888428, 0.014204860664904118]}",0.1152433529496193,Generation,0.03929519280791283
NLP Applications,MMPE: A Multi-Modal Interface for Post-Editing Machine Translation,"Current advances in machine translation (MT) increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and reduces errors. This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard, we present MMPE, the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen, touch, and speech modalities for PE of MT. The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while they are of limited use for longer insertions. On the other hand, speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions but offer less potential for deletion and reordering. Overall, participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as good extensions to mouse & keyboard, but not as a complete substitute.","{'sequence': 'Current advances in machine translation (MT) increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and reduces errors.

NLP Applications,Efficient Strategies for Hierarchical Text Classification: External Knowledge and Auxiliary Tasks,"In hierarchical text classification, we perform a sequence of inference steps to predict the category of a document from top to bottom of a given class taxonomy. Most of the studies have focused on developing novels neural network architectures to deal with the hierarchical structure, but we prefer to look for efficient ways to strengthen a baseline model. We first define the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Afterwards, we propose an auxiliary synthetic task of bottom-up-classification. Then, from external dictionaries, we retrieve textual definitions for the classes of all the hierarchy's layers, and map them into the word vector space. We use the class-definition embeddings as an additional input to condition the prediction of the next layer and in an adapted beam search. Whereas the modified search did not provide large gains, the combination of the auxiliary task and the additional input of classdefinitions significantly enhance the classification accuracy.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-speech Tagging via Two-way Attentions of Auto-analyzed Knowledge,"Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and partof-speech (POS) tagging are important fundamental tasks for Chinese language processing, where joint learning of them is an effective one-step solution for both tasks. Previous studies for joint CWS and POS tagging mainly follow the character-based tagging paradigm with introducing contextual information such as n-gram features or sentential representations from recurrent neural models. However, for many cases, the joint tagging needs not only modeling from context features but also knowledge attached to them (e.g., syntactic relations among words); limited efforts have been made by existing research to meet such needs. In this paper, we propose a neural model named TWASP for joint CWS and POS tagging following the character-based sequence labeling paradigm, where a two-way attention mechanism is used to incorporate both context feature and their corresponding syntactic knowledge for each input character. Particularly, we use existing language processing toolkits to obtain the auto-analyzed syntactic knowledge for the context, and the proposed attention module can learn and benefit from them although their quality may not be perfect.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",A Multitask Learning Approach for Diacritic Restoration,"In many languages like Arabic, diacritics are used to specify pronunciations as well as meanings. Such diacritics are often omitted in written text, increasing the number of possible pronunciations and meanings for a word. This results in a more ambiguous text making computational processing on such text more difficult. Diacritic restoration is the task of restoring missing diacritics in the written text. Most state-of-the-art diacritic restoration models are built on character level information which helps generalize the model to unseen data, but presumably lose useful information at the word level. Thus, to compensate for this loss, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to jointly optimize diacritic restoration with related NLP problems namely word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic diacritization. We use Arabic as a case study since it has sufficient data resources for tasks that we consider in our joint modeling.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Improving Chinese Word Segmentation with Wordhood Memory Networks,"Contextual features always play an important role in Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Wordhood information, being one of the contextual features, is proved to be useful in many conventional character-based segmenters.

In this paper, we therefore propose a neural framework, WMSEG, which uses memory networks to incorporate wordhood information with several popular encoder-decoder combinations for CWS. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate the memory mechanism successfully models wordhood information for neural segmenters and helps WMSEG achieve state-ofthe-art performance on all those datasets.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Completion,"We propose the task of unsupervised morphological paradigm completion. Given only raw text and a lemma list, the task consists of generating the morphological paradigms, i.e., all inflected forms, of the lemmas. From a natural language processing (NLP) perspective, this is a challenging unsupervised task, and high-performing systems have the potential to improve tools for low-resource languages or to assist linguistic annotators.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Coupling Distant Annotation and Adversarial Training for Cross-Domain Chinese Word Segmentation,"Fully supervised neural approaches have achieved significant progress in the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Nevertheless, the performance of supervised models tends to drop dramatically when they are applied to outof-domain data. Performance degradation is caused by the distribution gap across domains and the out of vocabulary (OOV) problem. In order to simultaneously alleviate these two issues, this paper proposes to couple distant annotation and adversarial training for crossdomain CWS. For distant annotation, we rethink the essence of ""Chinese words"" and design an automatic distant annotation mechanism that does not need any supervision or pre-defined dictionaries from the target domain. The approach could effectively explore domain-specific words and distantly annotate the raw texts for the target domain. For adversarial training, we develop a sentence-level training procedure to perform noise reduction and maximum utilization of the source domain information.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Predicting Declension Class from Form and Meaning,"The noun lexica of many natural languages are divided into several declension classes with characteristic morphological properties. Class membership is far from deterministic, but the phonological form of a noun and its meaning can often provide imperfect clues. Here, we investigate the strength of those clues. More specifically, we operationalize ""strength"" as measuring how much information, in bits, we can glean about declension class from knowing the form and meaning of nouns. We know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender-which, as we quantitatively verify, can itself share information with declension class-so we also control for gender. We find for two Indo-European languages (Czech and German) that form and meaning share a significant amount of information with class (and contribute additional information beyond gender). The three-way interaction between class, form, and meaning (given gender) is also significant. Our study is important for two reasons: First, we introduce a new method that provides additional quantitative support for a classic linguistic finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into declensions. Second, we show not only that individual declension classes vary in the strength of their clues within a language, but also that the variations between classes vary across languages.

Finally, we introduce a new dataset of romanized Russian, collected from a Russian social network website and partially annotated for our experiments. 1"", 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Summarization', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'NLP Applications', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP'], 'scores': [0.09164772927761078, 0.08170024305582047, 0.07253143936395645, 0.061478257179260254, 0.061215370893478394, 0.057970691472291946, 0.057742610573768616, 0.053393203765153885, 0.05327705293893814, 0.04986439645290375, 0.045028552412986755, 0.04345749691128731, 0.04036625102162361, 0.04003868252038956, 0.03273747116327286, 0.0283123180270195, 0.02487107180058956, 0.02305588126182556, 0.019916487857699394, 0.017459357157349586, 0.01685219444334507, 0.01637016423046589, 0.010713019408285618]}",0.09164772927761078,Information Extraction,0.053393203765153885
Question Answering,A Methodology for Creating Question Answering Corpora Using Inverse Data Annotation,"In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data. For this, we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database called Operation Trees (OT). This representation allows us to invert the annotation process without losing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our corpus is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to increase the performance significantly.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data.

Question Answering,Break It Down: A Question Understanding Benchmark,"Understanding natural language questions entails the ability to break down a question into the requisite steps for computing its answer. In this work, we introduce a Question Decomposition Meaning Representation (QDMR) for questions. QDMR constitutes the ordered list of steps, expressed through natural language, that are necessary for answering a question. We develop a crowdsourcing pipeline, showing that quality QDMRs can be annotated at scale, and release the BREAK dataset, containing over 83K pairs of questions and their QDMRs. We demonstrate the utility of QDMR by showing that (a) it can be used to improve open-domain question answering on the HOTPOTQA dataset, (b) it can be deterministically converted to a pseudo-SQL formal language, which can alleviate annotation in semantic parsing applications. Last, we use BREAK to train a sequence-to-sequence model with copying that parses questions into QDMR structures, and show that it substantially outperforms several natural baselines.","{'sequence': 'Understanding natural language questions entails the ability to break down a question into the requisite steps for computing its answer.

Question Answering,A Frame-based Sentence Representation for Machine Reading Comprehension,"Sentence representation (SR) is the most crucial and challenging task in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC).

To bridge the gap, we proposed a novel Frame-based Sentence Representation (FSR) method, which employs frame semantic knowledge to facilitate sentence modelling.

Question Answering,Improving Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using Knowledge Base Embeddings,"Knowledge Graphs (KG) are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities as nodes and relations among them as typed edges. Goal of the Question Answering over KG (KGQA) task is to answer natural language queries posed over the KG. Multi-hop KGQA requires reasoning over multiple edges of the KG to arrive at the right answer. KGs are often incomplete with many missing links, posing additional challenges for KGQA, especially for multi-hop KGQA. Recent research on multihop KGQA has attempted to handle KG sparsity using relevant external text, which isn't always readily available. In a separate line of research, KG embedding methods have been proposed to reduce KG sparsity by performing missing link prediction. Such KG embedding methods, even though highly relevant, have not been explored for multi-hop KGQA so far. We fill this gap in this paper and propose EmbedKGQA. EmbedKGQA is particularly effective in performing multi-hop KGQA over sparse KGs. EmbedKGQA also relaxes the requirement of answer selection from a prespecified neighborhood, a sub-optimal constraint enforced by previous multi-hop KGQA methods. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate EmbedKGQA's effectiveness over other stateof-the-art baselines.","{'sequence': ""Knowledge Graphs (KG) are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities as nodes and relations among them as typed edges.

Question Answering,Learning to Identify Follow-Up Questions in Conversational Question Answering,"Despite recent progress in conversational question answering, most prior work does not focus on follow-up questions. Practical conversational question answering systems often receive follow-up questions in an ongoing conversation, and it is crucial for a system to be able to determine whether a question is a follow-up question of the current conversation, for more effective answer finding subsequently. In this paper, we introduce a new follow-up question identification task. We propose a three-way attentive pooling network that determines the suitability of a follow-up question by capturing pair-wise interactions between the associated passage, the conversation history, and a candidate follow-up question. It enables the model to capture topic continuity and topic shift while scoring a particular candidate follow-up question.

It enables the model to capture topic continuity and topic shift while scoring a particular candidate follow-up question. Experiments show that our proposed three-way attentive pooling network outperforms all baseline systems by significant margins.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Generation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10288415104150772, 0.09199848771095276, 0.08595143258571625, 0.052129365503787994, 0.050889693200588226, 0.04843052104115486, 0.04655494540929794, 0.044239241629838943, 0.042973458766937256, 0.04148209095001221, 0.040356237441301346, 0.03753383830189705, 0.03701557591557503, 0.03236391395330429, 0.03147954121232033, 0.031246913596987724, 0.03109852410852909, 0.03025013953447342, 0.0292514655739069, 0.026055054739117622, 0.02528015524148941, 0.02326010912656784, 0.01727515272796154]}",0.10288415104150772,Question Answering,0.10288415104150772
Question Answering,Harvesting and Refining Question-Answer Pairs for Unsupervised QA,"Question Answering (QA) has shown great success thanks to the availability of largescale datasets and the effectiveness of neural models. Recent research works have attempted to extend these successes to the settings with few or no labeled data available. In this work, we introduce two approaches to improve unsupervised QA. First, we harvest lexically and syntactically divergent questions from Wikipedia to automatically construct a corpus of question-answer pairs (named as REFQA). Second, we take advantage of the QA model to extract more appropriate answers, which iteratively refines data over RE-FQA. We conduct experiments 1 on SQuAD 1.1, and NewsQA by fine-tuning BERT without access to manually annotated data. Our approach outperforms previous unsupervised approaches by a large margin and is competitive with early supervised models. We also show the effectiveness of our approach in the fewshot learning setting.","{'sequence': 'Question Answering (QA) has shown great success thanks to the availability of largescale datasets and the effectiveness of neural models.

Question Answering,Document Modeling with Graph Attention Networks for Multi-grained Machine Reading Comprehension,"Natural Questions is a new challenging machine reading comprehension benchmark with two-grained answers, which are a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities inside the long answer). Despite the effectiveness of existing methods on this benchmark, they treat these two sub-tasks individually during training while ignoring their dependencies. To address this issue, we present a novel multi-grained machine reading comprehension framework that focuses on modeling documents at their hierarchical nature, which are different levels of granularity: documents, paragraphs, sentences, and tokens. We utilize graph attention networks to obtain different levels of representations so that they can be learned simultaneously. The long and short answers can be extracted from paragraphlevel representation and token-level representation, respectively. In this way, we can model the dependencies between the two-grained answers to provide evidence for each other. We jointly train the two sub-tasks, and our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous systems at both long and short answer criteria.","{'sequence': 'Natural Questions is a new challenging machine reading comprehension benchmark with two-grained answers, which are a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities inside the long answer).

Question Answering,SCDE: Sentence Cloze Dataset with High Quality Distractors From Examinations,"We introduce SCDE, a dataset to evaluate the performance of computational models through sentence prediction. SCDE is a humancreated sentence cloze dataset, collected from public school English examinations. Our task requires a model to fill up multiple blanks in a passage from a shared candidate set with distractors designed by English teachers. Experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local, discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. The blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each other's context. Furthermore, through ablations, we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging. Our experiments show that there is a significant performance gap between advanced models (72%) and humans (87%), encouraging future models to bridge this gap. 1 2 * Equal Contribution 1 Data: vgtomahawk.github.io/sced.html 2 Code: https://github.com/shawnkx/SCDE Passage: A student's life is never easy. And it is even more difficult if you will have to complete your study in a foreign land. 1 The following are some basic things you need to do before even seizing that passport and boarding on the plane. Knowing the country. You shouldn't bother researching the country's hottest tourist spots or historical places. You won't go there as a tourist, but as a student. 2 In addition, read about their laws. You surely don't want to face legal problems, especially if you're away from home. 3 Don't expect that you can graduate abroad without knowing even the basics of the language. Before leaving your home country, take online lessons to at least master some of their words and sentences. This will be useful in living and studying there. Doing this will also prepare you in communicating with those who can't speak English. Preparing for other needs. Check the conversion of your money to their local currency. 4. The Internet of your intended school will be very helpful in findings an apartment and helping you understand local currency. Remember, you're not only carrying your own reputation but your country's reputation as well. If you act foolishly, people there might think that all of your countrymen are foolish as well. 5 Candidates: A. Studying their language. B. That would surely be a very bad start for your study abroad program. C. Going with their trends will keep it from being too obvious that you're a foreigner. D. Set up your bank account so you can use it there, get an insurance, and find an apartment. E. It'll be helpful to read the most important points in their history and to read up on their culture. F.

Question Answering,Clinical Reading Comprehension: A Thorough Analysis of the emrQA Dataset,"Machine reading comprehension has made great progress in recent years owing to largescale annotated datasets. In the clinical domain, however, creating such datasets is quite difficult due to the domain expertise required for annotation. Recently, Pampari et al. (2018)   tackled this issue by using expert-annotated question templates and existing i2b2 annotations to create emrQA, the first large-scale dataset for question answering (QA) based on clinical notes. In this paper, we provide an indepth analysis of this dataset and the clinical reading comprehension (CliniRC) task. From our qualitative analysis, we find that (i) emrQA answers are often incomplete, and (ii) emrQA questions are often answerable without using domain knowledge. From our quantitative experiments, surprising results include that (iii) using a small sampled subset (5%-20%), we can obtain roughly equal performance compared to the model trained on the entire dataset, (iv) this performance is close to human expert's performance, and (v) BERT models do not beat the best performing base model. Following our analysis of the emrQA, we further explore two desired aspects of CliniRC systems: the ability to utilize clinical domain knowledge and to generalize to unseen questions and contexts. We argue that both should be considered when creating future datasets. 1","{'sequence': ""Machine reading comprehension has made great progress in recent years owing to largescale annotated datasets.

Question Answering,MLQA: Evaluating Cross-lingual Extractive Question Answering,"Question answering (QA) models have shown rapid progress enabled by the availability of large, high-quality benchmark datasets.

Question Answering,Crossing Variational Autoencoders for Answer Retrieval,"Answer retrieval is to find the most aligned answer from a large set of candidates given a question. Learning vector representations of questions/answers is the key factor. Questionanswer alignment and question/answer semantics are two important signals for learning the representations. Existing methods learned semantic representations with dual encoders or dual variational auto-encoders. The semantic information was learned from language models or question-to-question (answer-to-answer) generative processes. However, the alignment and semantics were too separate to capture the aligned semantics between question and answer.

In this paper, we present the first free-form multiple-Choice Chinese machine reading Comprehension dataset (C 3 ), containing 13,369 documents (dialogues or more formally written mixed-genre texts) and their associated 19,577 multiple-choice free-form questions collected from Chineseas-a-second-language examinations.

We implement rule-based and popular neural methods and find that there is still a significant performance gap between the best performing model (68.5%) and human readers (96.0%), especiallyon problems that require prior knowledge. We further study the effects of distractor plausibility and data augmentation based on translated relevant datasets for English on model performance. We expect C 3 to present great challenges to existing systems as answering 86.8% of questions requires both knowledge within and beyond the accompanying document, and we hope that C 3 can serve as a platform to study how to leverage various kinds of prior knowledge to better understand a given written or orally oriented text.

Our CuratedTREC score is even better than the best known retrieve & read model with at least 45x faster inference speed. 1', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.6491595506668091, 0.034315261989831924, 0.030430419370532036, 0.024380866438150406, 0.01975484937429428, 0.01973816007375717, 0.018710872158408165, 0.01860794797539711, 0.018359797075390816, 0.016249632462859154, 0.015729032456874847, 0.014674716629087925, 0.014391440898180008, 0.014321478083729744, 0.01295806746929884, 0.01289893314242363, 0.01184928696602583, 0.011296279728412628, 0.00968993455171585, 0.009225700050592422, 0.009084227494895458, 0.007573094218969345, 0.006600447464734316]}",0.6491595506668091,Question Answering,0.6491595506668091
Question Answering,Dynamic Sampling Strategies for Multi-Task Reading Comprehension,"Building general reading comprehension systems, capable of solving multiple datasets at the same time, is a recent aspirational goal in the research community. Prior work has focused on model architectures or generalization to held out datasets, and largely passed over the particulars of the multi-task learning set up. We show that a simple dynamic sampling strategy, selecting instances for training proportional to the multi-task model's current performance on a dataset relative to its singletask performance, gives substantive gains over prior multi-task sampling strategies, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting that is common in multi-task learning. We also demonstrate that allowing instances of different tasks to be interleaved as much as possible between each epoch and batch has a clear benefit in multitask performance over forcing task homogeneity at the epoch or batch level. Our final model shows greatly increased performance over the best model on ORB, a recently-released multitask reading comprehension benchmark.","{'sequence': ""Building general reading comprehension systems, capable of solving multiple datasets at the same time, is a recent aspirational goal in the research community.

Question Answering,A Self-Training Method for Machine Reading Comprehension with Soft Evidence Extraction,"Neural models have achieved great success on machine reading comprehension (MRC), many of which typically consist of two components: an evidence extractor and an answer predictor. The former seeks the most relevant information from a reference text, while the latter is to locate or generate answers from the extracted evidence. Despite the importance of evidence labels for training the evidence extractor, they are not cheaply accessible, particularly in many non-extractive MRC tasks such as YES/NO question answering and multi-choice MRC. To address this problem, we present a Self-Training method (STM), which supervises the evidence extractor with auto-generated evidence labels in an iterative process. At each iteration, a base MRC model is trained with golden answers and noisy evidence labels. The trained model will predict pseudo evidence labels as extra supervision in the next iteration. We evaluate STM on seven datasets over three MRC tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement on existing MRC models, and we also analyze how and why such a self-training method works in MRC.","{'sequence': 'Neural models have achieved great success on machine reading comprehension (MRC), many of which typically consist of two components: an evidence extractor and an answer predictor.

Question Answering,Explicit Memory Tracker with Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Conversational Machine Reading,"The goal of conversational machine reading is to answer user questions given a knowledge base text which may require asking clarification questions. Existing approaches are limited in their decision making due to struggles in extracting question-related rules and reasoning about them. In this paper, we present a new framework of conversational machine reading that comprises a novel Explicit Memory Tracker (EMT) to track whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision. Moreover, our framework generates clarification questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level entailment scores to weight token-level distributions. On the ShARC benchmark (blind, heldout) testset, EMT achieves new state-of-theart results of 74.6% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 49.5 BLEU4.

Question Answering,DeFormer: Decomposing Pre-trained Transformers for Faster Question Answering,"Transformer-based QA models use input-wide self-attention -i.e. across both the question and the input passage -at all layers, causing them to be slow and memory-intensive. It turns out that we can get by without inputwide self-attention at all layers, especially in the lower layers. We introduce DeFormer, a decomposed transformer, which substitutes the full self-attention with question-wide and passage-wide self-attentions in the lower layers. This allows for question-independent processing of the input text representations, which in turn enables pre-computing passage representations reducing runtime compute drastically. Furthermore, because DeFormer is largely similar to the original model, we can initialize DeFormer with the pre-training weights of a standard transformer, and directly fine-tune on the target QA dataset. We show DeFormer versions of BERT and XLNet can be used to speed up QA by over 4.3x and with simple distillation-based losses they incur only a 1% drop in accuracy.

To address this challenge, we propose a multi-source meta transfer (MMT) for low-resource MCQA. In this framework, we first extend meta learning by incorporating multiple training sources to learn a generalized feature representation across domains. To bridge the distribution gap between training sources and the target, we further introduce the meta transfer that can be integrated into the multi-source meta training.

Training a QA model on this data gives a relative improvement over a previous unsupervised model in F1 score on the SQuAD dataset by about 14%, and 20% when the answer is a named entity, achieving stateof-the-art performance on SQuAD for unsupervised QA.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond'], 'scores': [0.6622376441955566, 0.08813098073005676, 0.02744264341890812, 0.01840398460626602, 0.01830456778407097, 0.01765306293964386, 0.01649549975991249, 0.01414820458739996, 0.013778609223663807, 0.01210014708340168, 0.011971651576459408, 0.011679159477353096, 0.011201802641153336, 0.011159257031977177, 0.008501945063471794, 0.008296266198158264, 0.00791466049849987, 0.007813889533281326, 0.007496113423258066, 0.006891624070703983, 0.006590087898075581, 0.006554620806127787, 0.0052336640655994415]}",0.6622376441955566,Question Answering,0.6622376441955566
Question Answering,ClarQ: A large-scale and diverse dataset for Clarification Question Generation,"Question answering and conversational systems are often baffled and need help clarifying certain ambiguities. However, limitations of existing datasets hinder the development of large-scale models capable of generating and utilising clarification questions. In order to overcome these limitations, we devise a novel bootstrapping framework (based on self-supervision) that assists in the creation of a diverse, large-scale dataset of clarification questions based on post-comment tuples extracted from stackexchange. The framework utilises a neural network based architecture for classifying clarification questions. It is a two-step method where the first aims to increase the precision of the classifier and second aims to increase its recall. We quantitatively demonstrate the utility of the newly created dataset by applying it to the downstream task of question-answering. The final dataset, ClarQ, consists of ∼2M examples distributed across 173 domains of stackexchange. We release this dataset 1 in order to foster research into the field of clarification question generation with the larger goal of enhancing dialog and question answering systems.","{'sequence': 'Question answering and conversational systems are often baffled and need help clarifying certain ambiguities.

Question Answering,Low-Resource Generation of Multi-hop Reasoning Questions,"This paper focuses on generating multi-hop reasoning questions from the raw text in a low resource circumstance.

Since the labeled data is limited and insufficient for training, we propose to learn the model with the help of a large scale of unlabeled data that is much easier to obtain. Such data contains rich expressive forms of the questions with structural patterns on syntax and semantics.

We show that pre-training our model, GENBERT, on this data, dramatically improves performance on DROP (49.3 → 72.3 F 1 ), reaching performance that matches state-of-the-art models of comparable size, while using a simple and general-purpose encoder-decoder architecture.

Question Answering,Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension,"In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer. State-of-the-art models tend to use a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to encode the joint contextual information of document and question. However, these transformer-based models can only take a fixed-length (e.g., 512) text as its input. To deal with even longer text inputs, previous approaches usually chunk them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each segment independently without considering the information from other segments. As a result, they may form segments that fail to cover the correct answer span or retain insufficient contexts around it, which significantly degrades the performance. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need cross-segment information. We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next segment that it wants to process in either direction. We also employ recurrent mechanisms to enable information to flow across segments. Experiments on three MRC datasets -CoQA, QuAC, and TriviaQA -demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed recurrent chunking mechanisms: we can obtain segments that are more likely to contain complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the ground truth answers for better predictions.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer.

Question Answering,Selective Question Answering under Domain Shift,"To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering. Moreover, users often ask questions that diverge from the model's training data, making errors more likely and thus abstention more critical. In this work, we propose the setting of selective question answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a mixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain on) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuADtrained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy.","{'sequence': ""To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering.

Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuADtrained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy."", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation'], 'scores': [0.35813993215560913, 0.09765568375587463, 0.06995684653520584, 0.06236374005675316, 0.037257127463817596, 0.03632960468530655, 0.031730037182569504, 0.031674981117248535, 0.029324769973754883, 0.02767481841146946, 0.024304313585162163, 0.02086685039103031, 0.020674772560596466, 0.019267305731773376, 0.018510129302740097, 0.01756354235112667, 0.017320875078439713, 0.01602485030889511, 0.013715633191168308, 0.013516449369490147, 0.013051754795014858, 0.012021838687360287, 0.01105423178523779]}",0.35813993215560913,Question Answering,0.35813993215560913
Question Answering,R4C: A Benchmark for Evaluating RC Systems to Get the Right Answer for the Right Reason,"Recent studies have revealed that reading comprehension (RC) systems learn to exploit annotation artifacts and other biases in current datasets. This prevents the community from reliably measuring the progress of RC systems. To address this issue, we introduce R 4 C, a new task for evaluating RC systems' internal reasoning. R 4 C requires giving not only answers but also derivations: explanations that justify predicted answers. We present a reliable, crowdsourced framework for scalably annotating RC datasets with derivations. We create and publicly release the R 4 C dataset, the first, quality-assured dataset consisting of 4.6k questions, each of which is annotated with 3 reference derivations (i.e. 13.8k derivations). Experiments show that our automatic evaluation metrics using multiple reference derivations are reliable, and that R 4 C assesses different skills from an existing benchmark.","{'sequence': ""Recent studies have revealed that reading comprehension (RC) systems learn to exploit annotation artifacts and other biases in current datasets.

Resources and Evaluation,An Effectiveness Metric for Ordinal Classification: Formal Properties and Experimental Results,"In Ordinal Classification tasks, items have to be assigned to classes that have a relative ordering, such as positive, neutral, negative in sentiment analysis. Remarkably, the most popular evaluation metrics for ordinal classification tasks either ignore relevant information (for instance, precision/recall on each of the classes ignores their relative ordering) or assume additional information (for instance, Mean Average Error assumes absolute distances between classes). In this paper we propose a new metric for Ordinal Classification, Closeness Evaluation Measure, that is rooted on Measurement Theory and Information Theory. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results over both synthetic data and data from NLP shared tasks indicate that the proposed metric captures quality aspects from different traditional tasks simultaneously.

In this paper we propose a new metric for Ordinal Classification, Closeness Evaluation Measure, that is rooted on Measurement Theory and Information Theory. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results over both synthetic data and data from NLP shared tasks indicate that the proposed metric captures quality aspects from different traditional tasks simultaneously.

Resources and Evaluation,PuzzLing Machines: A Challenge on Learning From Small Data,"Deep neural models have repeatedly proved excellent at memorizing surface patterns from large datasets for various ML and NLP benchmarks. They struggle to achieve human-like thinking, however, because they lack the skill of iterative reasoning upon knowledge. To expose this problem in a new light, we introduce a challenge on learning from small data, PuzzLing Machines, which consists of Rosetta Stone puzzles from Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. These puzzles are carefully designed to contain only the minimal amount of parallel text necessary to deduce the form of unseen expressions. Solving them does not require external information (e.g., knowledge bases, visual signals) or linguistic expertise, but meta-linguistic awareness and deductive skills. Our challenge contains around 100 puzzles covering a wide range of linguistic phenomena from 81 languages. We show that both simple statistical algorithms and state-of-the-art deep neural models perform inadequately on this challenge, as expected. We hope that this benchmark, available at https://ukplab.github.io/ PuzzLing-Machines/, inspires further efforts towards a new paradigm in NLP-one that is grounded in human-like reasoning and understanding.","{'sequence': 'Deep neural models have repeatedly proved excellent at memorizing surface patterns from large datasets for various ML and NLP benchmarks.

Resources and Evaluation,Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList,"Although measuring held-out accuracy has been the primary approach to evaluate generalization, it often overestimates the performance of NLP models, while alternative approaches for evaluating models either focus on individual tasks or on specific behaviors. Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a taskagnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly.

Resources and Evaluation,Multi-Hypothesis Machine Translation Evaluation,"Reliably evaluating Machine Translation (MT) through automated metrics is a long-standing problem. One of the main challenges is the fact that multiple outputs can be equally valid. Attempts to minimise this issue include metrics that relax the matching of MT output and reference strings, and the use of multiple references. The latter has been shown to significantly improve the performance of evaluation metrics. However, collecting multiple references is expensive and in practice a single reference is generally used. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: instead of modelling linguistic variation in human reference we exploit the MT model uncertainty to generate multiple diverse translations and use these: (i) as surrogates to reference translations; (ii) to obtain a quantification of translation variability to either complement existing metric scores or (iii) replace references altogether. We show that for a number of popular evaluation metrics our variability estimates lead to substantial improvements in correlation with human judgements of quality by up 15%.","{'sequence': 'Reliably evaluating Machine Translation (MT) through automated metrics is a long-standing problem.

Resources and Evaluation,Facet-Aware Evaluation for Extractive Summarization,"Commonly adopted metrics for extractive summarization focus on lexical overlap at the token level. In this paper, we present a facetaware evaluation setup for better assessment of the information coverage in extracted summaries. Specifically, we treat each sentence in the reference summary as a facet, identify the sentences in the document that express the semantics of each facet as support sentences of the facet, and automatically evaluate extractive summarization methods by comparing the indices of extracted sentences and support sentences of all the facets in the reference summary. To facilitate this new evaluation setup, we construct an extractive version of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and perform a thorough quantitative investigation, through which we demonstrate that facet-aware evaluation manifests better correlation with human judgment than ROUGE, enables fine-grained evaluation as well as comparative analysis, and reveals valuable insights of state-of-the-art summarization methods. 1 Reference: Three people in Kansas have died from a listeria outbreak. Lexical Overlap: But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. (ROUGE-1 F1=37.0, multiple token matches but totally different semantics) Manual Extract: Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to blue bell creameries products, according to the CDC. (ROUGE-1 F1=36.9, semantics covered but lower ROUGE due to the presence of other details) Reference: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and United manager Louis van Gaal are pals.

Resources and Evaluation,Learning and Evaluating Emotion Lexicons for 91 Languages,"Emotion lexicons describe the affective meaning of words and thus constitute a centerpiece for advanced sentiment and emotion analysis. Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

Resources and Evaluation,WinoWhy: A Deep Diagnosis of Essential Commonsense Knowledge for Answering Winograd Schema Challenge,"In this paper, we present the first comprehensive categorization of essential commonsense knowledge for answering the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC). For each of the questions, we invite annotators to first provide reasons for making correct decisions and then categorize them into six major knowledge categories. By doing so, we better understand the limitation of existing methods (i.e., what kind of knowledge cannot be effectively represented or inferred with existing methods) and shed some light on the commonsense knowledge that we need to acquire in the future for better commonsense reasoning. Moreover, to investigate whether current WSC models can understand the commonsense or they simply solve the WSC questions based on the statistical bias of the dataset, we leverage the collected reasons to develop a new task called WinoWhy, which requires models to distinguish plausible reasons from very similar but wrong reasons for all WSC questions. Experimental results prove that even though pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising progress on the original WSC dataset, they are still struggling at WinoWhy. Further experiments show that even though supervised models can achieve better performance, the performance of these models can be sensitive to the dataset distribution.

Resources and Evaluation,MIND: A Large-scale Dataset for News Recommendation,"News recommendation is an important technique for personalized news service. Compared with product and movie recommendations which have been comprehensively studied, the research on news recommendation is much more limited, mainly due to the lack of a high-quality benchmark dataset. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset named MIND for news recommendation. Constructed from the user click logs of Microsoft News, MIND contains 1 million users and more than 160k English news articles, each of which has rich textual content such as title, abstract and body. We demonstrate MIND a good testbed for news recommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art news recommendation methods which are originally developed on different proprietary datasets. Our results show the performance of news recommendation highly relies on the quality of news content understanding and user interest modeling. Many natural language processing techniques such as effective text representation methods and pre-trained language models can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation.

Recently, multilingual contextual embedding models, trained on multiple monolingual corpora, have shown promising results on cross-lingual and multilingual tasks. We present an evaluation benchmark, GLUECoS, for code-switched languages, that spans several NLP tasks in English-Hindi and English-Spanish. Specifically, our evaluation benchmark includes Language Identification from text, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering and a new task for code-switching, Natural Language Inference. We present results on all these tasks using cross-lingual word embedding models and multilingual models. In addition, we fine-tune multilingual models on artificially generated code-switched data.

Resources and Evaluation,ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations,"In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary. Despite these varied range of possible text alterations, current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation, such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed.","{'sequence': 'In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary.

Resources and Evaluation,More Diverse Dialogue Datasets via Diversity-Informed Data Collection,"Automated generation of conversational dialogue using modern neural architectures has made notable advances. However, these models are known to have a drawback of often producing uninteresting, predictable responses; this is known as the diversity problem. We introduce a new strategy to address this problem, called Diversity-Informed Data Collection. Unlike prior approaches, which modify model architectures to solve the problem, this method uses dynamically computed corpuslevel statistics to determine which conversational participants to collect data from. Diversity-Informed Data Collection produces significantly more diverse data than baseline data collection methods, and better results on two downstream tasks: emotion classification and dialogue generation. This method is generalizable and can be used with other corpuslevel metrics.","{'sequence': 'Automated generation of conversational dialogue using modern neural architectures has made notable advances.

Resources and Evaluation,A Recipe for Creating Multimodal Aligned Datasets for Sequential Tasks,"Many high-level procedural tasks can be decomposed into sequences of instructions that vary in their order and choice of tools. In the cooking domain, the web offers many partially-overlapping text and video recipes (i.e. procedures) that describe how to make the same dish (i.e. high-level task). Aligning instructions for the same dish across different sources can yield descriptive visual explanations that are far richer semantically than conventional textual instructions, providing commonsense insight into how real-world procedures are structured. Learning to align these different instruction sets is challenging because: a) different recipes vary in their order of instructions and use of ingredients; and b) video instructions can be noisy and tend to contain far more information than text instructions. To address these challenges, we first use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the same dish. We then use a graph algorithm to derive a joint alignment between multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish. We release the MICROSOFT RESEARCH MUL-TIMODAL ALIGNED RECIPE CORPUS 1 containing ∼150K pairwise alignments between recipes across 4,262 dishes with rich commonsense information. * Work done when the author was an intern at Microsoft. 1 https://github.com/microsoft/ multimodal-aligned-recipe-corpus 7.

The experimental results show that our metric achieves state-of-the-art human judgment correlation.', 'labels': ['Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.0816817507147789, 0.08089273422956467, 0.07082080841064453, 0.06667536497116089, 0.05688830465078354, 0.05142293497920036, 0.05130435898900032, 0.049361348152160645, 0.045642267912626266, 0.043480224907398224, 0.04326203092932701, 0.04067028686404228, 0.03987680375576019, 0.03737354651093483, 0.036575205624103546, 0.03601040691137314, 0.03302207216620445, 0.031386904418468475, 0.023210931569337845, 0.02210363931953907, 0.020992975682020187, 0.01988111436367035, 0.01746397465467453]}",0.0816817507147789,Computational Social Science and Social Media,0.08089273422956467

Our framework introduces a principled structure for the answer choices and ties them to textual span annotations. The framework is implemented in OneStopQA, a new high-quality dataset for evaluation and analysis of reading comprehension in English. We use this dataset to demonstrate that STARC can be leveraged for a key new application for the development of SAT-like reading comprehension materials: automatic annotation quality probing via span ablation experiments. We further show that it enables in-depth analyses and comparisons between machine and human reading comprehension behavior, including error distributions and guessing ability. Our experiments also reveal that the standard multiple choice dataset in NLP, RACE (Lai et al., 2017) , is limited in its ability to measure reading comprehension. 47% of its questions can be guessed by machines without accessing the passage, and 18% are unanimously judged by humans as not having a unique correct answer.

Second, it has a real-world size -600 training, 310 dev, and 490 evaluation question/answer pairs -thus reflecting the cost of creating large labeled datasets with actual data. Hence, TECHQA is meant to stimulate research in domain adaptation rather than as a resource to build QA systems from scratch.

Resources and Evaluation,Not All Claims are Created Equal: Choosing the Right Statistical Approach to Assess Hypotheses,"Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues. While alternative proposals have been well-debated and adopted in other fields, they remain rarely discussed or used within the NLP community. We address this gap by contrasting various hypothesis assessment techniques, especially those not commonly used in the field (such as evaluations based on Bayesian inference). Since these statistical techniques differ in the hypotheses they can support, we argue that practitioners should first decide their target hypothesis before choosing an assessment method. This is crucial because common fallacies, misconceptions, and misinterpretation surrounding hypothesis assessment methods often stem from a discrepancy between what one would like to claim versus what the method used actually assesses. Our survey reveals that these issues are omnipresent in the NLP research community. As a step forward, we provide best practices and guidelines tailored towards NLP research, as well as an easy-to-use package called HyBayes for Bayesian assessment of hypotheses, 1 complementing existing tools.","{'sequence': 'Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Verbal Multiword Expressions for Identification of Metaphor,"Metaphor is a linguistic device in which a concept is expressed by mentioning another. Identifying metaphorical expressions, therefore, requires a non-compositional understanding of semantics. Multiword Expressions (MWEs), on the other hand, are linguistic phenomena with varying degrees of semantic opacity and their identification poses a challenge to computational models. This work is the first attempt at analysing the interplay of metaphor and MWEs processing through the design of a neural architecture whereby classification of metaphors is enhanced by informing the model of the presence of MWEs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ""MWE-aware"" metaphor identification system paving the way for further experiments on the complex interactions of these phenomena. The results and analyses show that this proposed architecture reach state-of-the-art on two different established metaphor datasets.","{'sequence': 'Metaphor is a linguistic device in which a concept is expressed by mentioning another.

The results and analyses show that this proposed architecture reach state-of-the-art on two different established metaphor datasets.', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Generation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08183407038450241, 0.06694800406694412, 0.06583812087774277, 0.06323310732841492, 0.06279252469539642, 0.06144203245639801, 0.05252104625105858, 0.049920473247766495, 0.04426054283976555, 0.0421278215944767, 0.041201524436473846, 0.04099956154823303, 0.03960106894373894, 0.03499165177345276, 0.0331018827855587, 0.03161507099866867, 0.03135214000940323, 0.029202058911323547, 0.02793028950691223, 0.02770661935210228, 0.025817012414336205, 0.02554277516901493, 0.02002060040831566]}",0.08183407038450241,Speech and Multimodality,0.06583812087774277
Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Moving Down the Long Tail of Word Sense Disambiguation with Gloss Informed Bi-encoders,"A major obstacle in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is that word senses are not uniformly distributed, causing existing models to generally perform poorly on senses that are either rare or unseen during training. We propose a bi-encoder model that independently embeds (1) the target word with its surrounding context and (2) the dictionary definition, or gloss, of each sense. The encoders are jointly optimized in the same representation space, so that sense disambiguation can be performed by finding the nearest sense embedding for each target word embedding. Our system outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on English all-words WSD; these gains predominantly come from improved performance on rare senses, leading to a 31.1% error reduction on less frequent senses over prior work. This demonstrates that rare senses can be more effectively disambiguated by modeling their definitions.","{'sequence': 'A major obstacle in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is that word senses are not uniformly distributed, causing existing models to generally perform poorly on senses that are either rare or unseen during training.

We note prominent improvements, especially for more distant language pairs (i.e., languages with nonisomorphic monolingual spaces)."", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10674276202917099, 0.08060295879840851, 0.07840171456336975, 0.07793927937746048, 0.06989515572786331, 0.06389487534761429, 0.06050954759120941, 0.05346444249153137, 0.05306529253721237, 0.04193000867962837, 0.0343957282602787, 0.03185606002807617, 0.028580090031027794, 0.026515675708651543, 0.025854092091321945, 0.025143716484308243, 0.024389119818806648, 0.024109255522489548, 0.02380157634615898, 0.022122085094451904, 0.019834626466035843, 0.019147565588355064, 0.007804264780133963]}",0.10674276202917099,Question Answering,0.06389487534761429

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Adaptive Compression of Word Embeddings,"Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the large memory footprint of word embeddings makes it challenging to deploy NLP models to memory-constrained devices (e.g., selfdriving cars, mobile devices). In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings. We fundamentally follow a code-book approach that represents words as discrete codes such as (8, 5, 2, 4). However, unlike prior works that assign the same length of codes to all words, we adaptively assign different lengths of codes to each word by learning downstream tasks. The proposed method works in two steps. First, each word directly learns to select its code length in an end-to-end manner by applying the Gumbel-softmax tricks. After selecting the code length, each word learns discrete codes through a neural network with a binary constraint. To showcase the general applicability of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance on four different downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly show that our method is effective and makes the highly compressed word embeddings without hurting the task accuracy. Moreover, we show that our model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.","{'sequence': 'Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Investigating Word-Class Distributions in Word Vector Spaces,"This paper presents an investigation on the distribution of word vectors belonging to a certain word class in a pre-trained word vector space. To this end, we made several assumptions about the distribution, modeled the distribution accordingly, and validated each assumption by comparing the goodness of each model. Specifically, we considered two types of word classes -the semantic class of direct objects of a verb and the semantic class in a thesaurus -and tried to build models that properly estimate how likely it is that a word in the vector space is a member of a given word class. Our results on selectional preference and WordNet datasets show that the centroid-based model will fail to achieve good enough performance, the geometry of the distribution and the existence of subgroups will have limited impact, and also the negative instances need to be considered for adequate modeling of the distribution. We further investigated the relationship between the scores calculated by each model and the degree of membership and found that discriminative learning-based models are best in finding the boundaries of a class, while models based on the offset between positive and negative instances perform best in determining the degree of membership.","{'sequence': 'This paper presents an investigation on the distribution of word vectors belonging to a certain word class in a pre-trained word vector space.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,CluBERT: A Cluster-Based Approach for Learning Sense Distributions in Multiple Languages,"Knowing the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) of a word has been proved to help Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) models significantly. However, the scarcity of sense-annotated data makes it difficult to induce a reliable and highcoverage distribution of the meanings in a language vocabulary. To address this issue, in this paper we present CluBERT, an automatic and multilingual approach for inducing the distributions of word senses from a corpus of raw sentences. Our experiments show that Clu-BERT learns distributions over English senses that are of higher quality than those extracted by alternative approaches. When used to induce the MFS of a lemma, CluBERT attains state-of-the-art results on the English Word Sense Disambiguation tasks and helps to improve the disambiguation performance of two off-the-shelf WSD models. Moreover, our distributions also prove to be effective in other languages, beating all their alternatives for computing the MFS on the multilingual WSD tasks.

The only requirement is that there are some shared parameters in the top layers of the multi-lingual encoder. To better understand this result, we also show that representations from monolingual BERT models in different languages can be aligned post-hoc quite effectively, strongly suggesting that, much like for non-contextual word embeddings, there are universal latent symmetries in the learned embedding spaces.

To better understand this result, we also show that representations from monolingual BERT models in different languages can be aligned post-hoc quite effectively, strongly suggesting that, much like for non-contextual word embeddings, there are universal latent symmetries in the learned embedding spaces. For multilingual masked language modeling, these symmetries are automatically discovered and aligned during the joint training process. * Equal contribution.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",TaPas: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training,"Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task. To alleviate the collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition, the generated logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving the denotation. In this paper, we present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT's architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia, and is trained end-to-end. We experiment with three different semantic parsing datasets, and find that TAPAS outperforms or rivals semantic parsing models by improving state-of-the-art accuracy on SQA from 55.1 to 67.2 and performing on par with the state-of-the-art on WIKISQL and WIKITQ, but with a simpler model architecture.

We additionally find that transfer learning, which is trivial in our setting, from WIK-ISQL to WIKITQ, yields 48.7 accuracy, 4.2 points above the state-of-the-art."", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.39837953448295593, 0.05067877843976021, 0.04201473668217659, 0.039491165429353714, 0.03919962793588638, 0.036074165254831314, 0.03510867431759834, 0.034927062690258026, 0.03177826106548309, 0.0316774845123291, 0.029585884883999825, 0.02829635515809059, 0.027251457795500755, 0.02666684426367283, 0.02266204170882702, 0.022157743573188782, 0.021959690377116203, 0.020487524569034576, 0.02010110206902027, 0.016756951808929443, 0.012022161856293678, 0.008578595705330372, 0.00414425740018487]}",0.39837953448295593,Question Answering,0.034927062690258026
"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Parsing into Variable-in-situ Logico-Semantic Graphs,"We propose variable-in-situ logico-semantic graphs to bridge the gap between semantic graph and logical form parsing. The new type of graph-based meaning representation allows us to include analysis for scope-related phenomena, such as quantification, negation and modality, in a way that is consistent with the state-of-the-art underspecification approach. Moreover, the well-formedness of such a graph is clear, since model-theoretic interpretation is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective by developing a new state-of-the-art semantic parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics. At the core of this parser is a novel neural graph rewriting system which combines the strengths of Hyperedge Replacement Grammar, a knowledgeintensive model, and Graph Neural Networks, a data-intensive model. Our parser achieves an accuracy of 92.39% in terms of ELEMENTARY DEPENDENCY MATCH, which is a 2.88 point improvement over the best data-driven model in the literature.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Syntactic Data Augmentation Increases Robustness to Inference Heuristics,"Pretrained neural models such as BERT, when fine-tuned to perform natural language inference (NLI), often show high accuracy on standard datasets, but display a surprising lack of sensitivity to word order on controlled challenge sets. We hypothesize that this issue is not primarily caused by the pretrained model's limitations, but rather by the paucity of crowdsourced NLI examples that might convey the importance of syntactic structure at the finetuning stage. We explore several methods to augment standard training sets with syntactically informative examples, generated by applying syntactic transformations to sentences from the MNLI corpus. The best-performing augmentation method, subject/object inversion, improved BERT's accuracy on controlled examples that diagnose sensitivity to word order from 0.28 to 0.73, without affecting performance on the MNLI test set. This improvement generalized beyond the particular construction used for data augmentation, suggesting that augmentation causes BERT to recruit abstract syntactic representations.","{'sequence': ""Pretrained neural models such as BERT, when fine-tuned to perform natural language inference (NLI), often show high accuracy on standard datasets, but display a surprising lack of sensitivity to word order on controlled challenge sets.

Some triples are textual versions of facts, i.e., non-canonicalized mentions of entities and relations.

We repurpose SQuAD and NewsQA as an initial case study, and then show how the interactive corpora can be used to train a model that seeks relevant information through sequential decision making. We believe that this setting can contribute in scaling models to web-level QA scenarios. 1 * Equal contribution. 1 The dataset and implementation of our baseline agents are publicly available at https://github.com/ xingdi-eric-yuan/imrc_public.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Summarization', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'NLP Applications', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.23318682610988617, 0.10255919396877289, 0.04977651685476303, 0.0475301556289196, 0.04353199899196625, 0.04232623055577278, 0.039953652769327164, 0.039783623069524765, 0.03657379373908043, 0.03489549458026886, 0.03387244790792465, 0.033757299184799194, 0.03301166370511055, 0.030444948002696037, 0.030068403109908104, 0.025989416986703873, 0.02450813725590706, 0.022530334070324898, 0.021655011922121048, 0.02129891887307167, 0.020258251577615738, 0.020155854523181915, 0.012331834062933922]}",0.23318682610988617,Question Answering,0.039953652769327164

First, we debias the dataset through data augmentation and enhancement, but show that the model bias cannot be fully removed via this method. Next, we also compare two ways of directly debiasing the model without knowing what the dataset biases are in advance. The first approach aims to remove the label bias at the embedding level. The second approach employs a bag-of-words submodel to capture the features that are likely to exploit the bias and prevents the original model from learning these biased features by forcing orthogonality between these two submodels. We performed evaluations on new balanced datasets extracted from the original MNLI dataset as well as the NLI stress tests, and show that the orthogonality approach is better at debiasing the model while maintaining competitive overall accuracy. 1","{'sequence': 'While deep learning models are making fast progress on the task of Natural Language Inference, recent studies have also shown that these models achieve high accuracy by exploiting several dataset biases, and without deep understanding of the language semantics.

We performed evaluations on new balanced datasets extracted from the original MNLI dataset as well as the NLI stress tests, and show that the orthogonality approach is better at debiasing the model while maintaining competitive overall accuracy. 1', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1267203390598297, 0.10056222230195999, 0.0985984057188034, 0.05327640101313591, 0.04835829138755798, 0.04639653488993645, 0.044477563351392746, 0.04416875168681145, 0.04399259760975838, 0.04268914833664894, 0.037503208965063095, 0.035247333347797394, 0.03437076881527901, 0.029346082359552383, 0.027480587363243103, 0.027420513331890106, 0.026980163529515266, 0.02648133598268032, 0.025454463437199593, 0.024718455970287323, 0.020653586834669113, 0.018362754955887794, 0.016740452498197556]}",0.1267203390598297,Machine Learning for NLP,0.04416875168681145
"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Do Neural Models Learn Systematicity of Monotonicity Inference in Natural Language?,"Despite the success of language models using neural networks, it remains unclear to what extent neural models have the generalization ability to perform inferences. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating whether neural models can learn systematicity of monotonicity inference in natural language, namely, the regularity for performing arbitrary inferences with generalization on composition. We consider four aspects of monotonicity inferences and test whether the models can systematically interpret lexical and logical phenomena on different training/test splits. A series of experiments show that three neural models systematically draw inferences on unseen combinations of lexical and logical phenomena when the syntactic structures of the sentences are similar between the training and test sets. However, the performance of the models significantly decreases when the structures are slightly changed in the test set while retaining all vocabularies and constituents already appearing in the training set. This indicates that the generalization ability of neural models is limited to cases where the syntactic structures are nearly the same as those in the training set. (1) P : Some [puppies ↑] ran.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",The Sensitivity of Language Models and Humans to Winograd Schema Perturbations,"Large-scale pretrained language models are the major driving force behind recent improvements in performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge, a widely employed test of commonsense reasoning ability. We show, however, with a new diagnostic dataset, that these models are sensitive to linguistic perturbations of the Winograd examples that minimally affect human understanding. Our results highlight interesting differences between humans and language models: language models are more sensitive to number or gender alternations and synonym replacements than humans, and humans are more stable and consistent in their predictions, maintain a much higher absolute performance, and perform better on non-associative instances than associative ones. Overall, humans are correct more often than out-of-the-box models, and the models are sometimes right for the wrong reasons.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Modeling Label Semantics for Predicting Emotional Reactions,"Predicting how events induce emotions in the characters of a story is typically seen as a standard multi-label classification task, which usually treats labels as anonymous classes to predict. They ignore information that may be conveyed by the emotion labels themselves. We propose that the semantics of emotion labels can guide a model's attention when representing the input story. Further, we observe that the emotions evoked by an event are often related: an event that evokes joy is unlikely to also evoke sadness. In this work, we explicitly model label classes via label embeddings, and add mechanisms that track label-label correlations both during training and inference. We also introduce a new semi-supervision strategy that regularizes for the correlations on unlabeled data. Our empirical evaluations show that modeling label semantics yields consistent benefits, and we advance the state-of-theart on an emotion inference task.","{'sequence': ""Predicting how events induce emotions in the characters of a story is typically seen as a standard multi-label classification task, which usually treats labels as anonymous classes to predict.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Relational Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in online reviews.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","ECPE-2D: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction based on Joint Two-Dimensional Representation, Interaction and Prediction","In recent years, a new interesting task, called emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis. It aims at extracting the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. To solve this task, the existing research employed a two-step framework, which first extracts individual emotion set and cause set, and then pair the corresponding emotions and causes. However, such a pipeline of two steps contains some inherent flaws: 1) the modeling does not aim at extracting the final emotion-cause pair directly; 2) the errors from the first step will affect the performance of the second step. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a new end-toend approach, called ECPE-Two-Dimensional (ECPE-2D), to represent the emotion-cause pairs by a 2D representation scheme. A 2D transformer module and two variants, windowconstrained and cross-road 2D transformers, are further proposed to model the interactions of different emotion-cause pairs. The 2D representation, interaction, and prediction are integrated into a joint framework. In addition to the advantages of joint modeling, the experimental results on the benchmark emotion cause corpus show that our approach improves the F1 score of the state-of-the-art from 61.28% to 68.89%.","{'sequence': 'In recent years, a new interesting task, called emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Agreement Prediction of Arguments in Cyber Argumentation for Detecting Stance Polarity and Intensity,"In online debates, users express different levels of agreement/disagreement with one another's arguments and ideas. Often levels of agreement/disagreement are implicit in the text and must be predicted to analyze collective opinions. Existing stance detection methods predict the polarity of a post's stance toward a topic or post, but don't consider the stance's degree of intensity. We introduce a new research problem, stance polarity and intensity prediction in response relationships between posts. This problem is challenging because differences in stance intensity are often subtle and require nuanced language understanding. Cyber argumentation research has shown that incorporating both stance polarity and intensity data in online debates leads to better discussion analysis. We explore five different learning models: Ridge-M regression, Ridge-S regression, SVR-RF-R, pkudblab-PIP, and T-PAN-PIP for predicting stance polarity and intensity in argumentation. These models are evaluated using a new dataset for stance polarity and intensity prediction collected using a cyber argumentation platform. The SVR-RF-R model performs best for prediction of stance polarity with an accuracy of 70.43% and intensity with RMSE of 0.596. This work is the first to train models for predicting a post's stance polarity and intensity in one combined value in cyber argumentation with reasonably good accuracy.","{'sequence': ""In online debates, users express different levels of agreement/disagreement with one another's arguments and ideas.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation,"In argumentation, people state premises to reason towards a conclusion. The conclusion conveys a stance towards some target, such as a concept or statement. Often, the conclusion remains implicit, though, since it is self-evident in a discussion or left out for rhetorical reasons. However, the conclusion is key to understanding an argument, and hence, to any application that processes argumentation. We thus study the question to what extent an argument's conclusion can be reconstructed from its premises. In particular, we argue here that a decisive step is to infer a conclusion's target, and we hypothesize that this target is related to the premises' targets. We develop two complementary target inference approaches: one ranks premise targets and selects the top-ranked target as the conclusion target, the other finds a new conclusion target in a learned embedding space using a triplet neural network. Our evaluation on corpora from two domains indicates that a hybrid of both approaches is best, outperforming several strong baselines.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Relation-Aware Collaborative Learning for Unified Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves three subtasks, i.e., aspect term extraction, opinion term extraction, and aspect-level sentiment classification. Most existing studies focused on one of these subtasks only. Several recent researches made successful attempts to solve the complete ABSA problem with a unified framework. However, the interactive relations among three subtasks are still underexploited. We argue that such relations encode collaborative signals between different subtasks. For example, when the opinion term is ""delicious"", the aspect term must be ""food"" rather than ""place"".

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",SpanMlt: A Span-based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction,"Aspect terms extraction and opinion terms extraction are two key problems of fine-grained Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The aspect-opinion pairs can provide a global profile about a product or service for consumers and opinion mining systems.

Although some recent co-extraction methods have been proposed to extract both terms jointly, they fail to extract them as pairs. To this end, this paper proposes an end-to-end method to solve the task of Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction (PAOTE). Furthermore, this paper treats the problem from a perspective of joint term and relation extraction rather than under the sequence tagging formulation performed in most prior works. We propose a multi-task learning framework based on shared spans, where the terms are extracted under the supervision of span boundaries.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Enhancing Cross-target Stance Detection with Transferable Semantic-Emotion Knowledge,"Stance detection is an important task, which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target. Remarkable success has been achieved when sufficient labeled training data is available. However, annotating sufficient data is labor-intensive, which establishes significant barriers for generalizing the stance classifier to the data with new targets. In this paper, we proposed a Semantic-Emotion Knowledge Transferring (SEKT) model for cross-target stance detection, which uses the external knowledge (semantic and emotion lexicons) as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer across different targets. Specifically, a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons, which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. Then, the learned semantic-emotion graph representation, which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains, is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledgeaware memory unit to the BiLSTM cell. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of SEKT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.","{'sequence': 'Stance detection is an important task, which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Modelling Context and Syntactical Features for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) consists of two conceptual tasks, namely an aspect extraction and an aspect sentiment classification. Rather than considering the tasks separately, we build an end-to-end ABSA solution. Previous works in ABSA tasks did not fully leverage the importance of syntactical information. Hence, the aspect extraction model often failed to detect the boundaries of multi-word aspect terms. On the other hand, the aspect sentiment classifier was unable to account for the syntactical correlation between aspect terms and the context words. This paper explores the grammatical aspect of the sentence and employs the self-attention mechanism for syntactical learning. We combine part-of-speech embeddings, dependencybased embeddings and contextualized embeddings (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to enhance the performance of the aspect extractor. We also propose the syntactic relative distance to de-emphasize the adverse effects of unrelated words, having weak syntactic connection with the aspect terms. This increases the accuracy of the aspect sentiment classifier. Our solutions outperform the state-of-the-art models on SemEval-2014 dataset in both two subtasks.","{'sequence': 'The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) consists of two conceptual tasks, namely an aspect extraction and an aspect sentiment classification.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",SKEP: Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis,"Recently, sentiment analysis has seen remarkable advance with the help of pre-training approaches. However, sentiment knowledge, such as sentiment words and aspect-sentiment pairs, is ignored in the process of pre-training, despite the fact that they are widely used in traditional sentiment analysis approaches. In this paper, we introduce Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training (SKEP) in order to learn a unified sentiment representation for multiple sentiment analysis tasks. With the help of automatically-mined knowledge, SKEP conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives, so as to embed sentiment information at the word, polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. In particular, the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification, aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair. Experiments on three kinds of sentiment tasks show that SKEP significantly outperforms strong pre-training baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on most of the test datasets.

We propose an unsupervised cross-lingual sentiment classification model named multi-view encoder-classifier (MVEC) that leverages an unsupervised machine translation (UMT) system and a language discriminator.

Speech and Multimodality,"Sentiment and Emotion help Sarcasm? A Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis","In this paper, we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion, and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario. We, at first, manually annotate the recently released multi-modal MUStARD sarcasm dataset with sentiment and emotion classes, both implicit and explicit. For multitasking, we propose two attention mechanisms, viz. Inter-segment Inter-modal Attention (I e -Attention) and Intra-segment Inter-modal Attention (I a -Attention). The main motivation of I e -Attention is to learn the relationship between the different segments of the sentence across the modalities. In contrast, I a -Attention focuses within the same segment of the sentence across the modalities. Finally, representations from both the attentions are concatenated and shared across the five classes (i.e., sarcasm, implicit sentiment, explicit sentiment, implicit emotion, explicit emotion) for multi-tasking. Experimental results on the extended version of the MUStARD dataset show the efficacy of our proposed approach for sarcasm detection over the existing state-of-theart systems. The evaluation also shows that the proposed multi-task framework yields better performance for the primary task, i.e., sarcasm detection, with the help of two secondary tasks, emotion and sentiment analysis.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion, and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario.

Speech and Multimodality,Multimodal and Multiresolution Speech Recognition with Transformers,"This paper presents an audio visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) system using a Transformer-based architecture. We particularly focus on the scene context provided by the visual information, to ground the ASR. We extract representations for audio features in the encoder layers of the transformer and fuse video features using an additional crossmodal multihead attention layer. Additionally, we incorporate a multitask training criterion for multiresolution ASR, where we train the model to generate both character and subword level transcriptions. Experimental results on the How2 dataset, indicate that multiresolution training can speed up convergence by around 50% and relatively improves word error rate (WER) performance by upto 18% over subword prediction models. Further, incorporating visual information improves performance with relative gains upto 3.76% over audio only models.

Our classifier uses a pretrained Speech-2-Vector encoder as bottleneck to generate word-level representations from speech features. This pretrained encoder learns to encode speech features for a word using an objective similar to Word2Vec. Our proposed approach just uses speech features and word segmentation information for predicting spoken utterance-level target labels.

With this data we built classifiers to automatically distinguish trusted from mistrusted speech, achieving an F1 of 66.1%. We next evaluated whether the strategies raters said they used to discriminate between truthful and deceptive responses were in fact useful.

Speech and Multimodality,MultiQT: Multimodal learning for real-time question tracking in speech,"We address a challenging and practical task of labeling questions in speech in real time during telephone calls to emergency medical services in English, which embeds within a broader decision support system for emergency call-takers. We propose a novel multimodal approach to real-time sequence labeling in speech. Our model treats speech and its own textual representation as two separate modalities or views, as it jointly learns from streamed audio and its noisy transcription into text via automatic speech recognition. Our results show significant gains of jointly learning from the two modalities when compared to text or audio only, under adverse noise and limited volume of training data. The results generalize to medical symptoms detection where we observe a similar pattern of improvements with multimodal learning.","{'sequence': 'We address a challenging and practical task of labeling questions in speech in real time during telephone calls to emergency medical services in English, which embeds within a broader decision support system for emergency call-takers.

Speech and Multimodality,Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers,"Recent Transformer-based contextual word representations, including BERT and XLNet, have shown state-of-the-art performance in multiple disciplines within NLP. Fine-tuning the trained contextual models on task-specific datasets has been the key to achieving superior performance downstream. While finetuning these pre-trained models is straightforward for lexical applications (applications with only language modality), it is not trivial for multimodal language (a growing area in NLP focused on modeling face-to-face communication). Pre-trained models don't have the necessary components to accept two extra modalities of vision and acoustic. In this paper, we proposed an attachment to BERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). MAG allows BERT and XL-Net to accept multimodal nonverbal data during fine-tuning. It does so by generating a shift to internal representation of BERT and XLNet; a shift that is conditioned on the visual and acoustic modalities. In our experiments, we study the commonly used CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet significantly boosts the sentiment analysis performance over previous baselines as well as language-only finetuning of BERT and XLNet. On the CMU-MOSI dataset, MAG-XLNet achieves humanlevel multimodal sentiment analysis performance for the first time in the NLP community.","{'sequence': ""Recent Transformer-based contextual word representations, including BERT and XLNet, have shown state-of-the-art performance in multiple disciplines within NLP.

Speech and Multimodality,Reasoning with Multimodal Sarcastic Tweets via Modeling Cross-Modality Contrast and Semantic Association,"Sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon to express the opposite of what one really means. With the rapid growth of social media, multimodal sarcastic tweets are widely posted on various social platforms. In multimodal context, sarcasm is no longer a pure linguistic phenomenon, and due to the nature of social media short text, the opposite is more often manifested via cross-modality expressions. Thus traditional text-based methods are insufficient to detect multimodal sarcasm. To reason with multimodal sarcastic tweets, in this paper, we propose a novel method for modeling cross-modality contrast in the associated context. Our method models both cross-modality contrast and semantic association by constructing the Decomposition and Relation Network (namely D&R Net). The decomposition network represents the commonality and discrepancy between image and text, and the relation network models the semantic association in cross-modality context.

Speech and Multimodality,Improved Speech Representations with Multi-Target Autoregressive Predictive Coding,"Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech. One example is Autoregressive Predictive Coding (Chung et al., 2019) , which trains an autoregressive RNN to generate an unseen future frame given a context such as recent past frames. The basic hypothesis of these approaches is that hidden states that can accurately predict future frames are a useful representation for many downstream tasks. In this paper we extend this hypothesis and aim to enrich the information encoded in the hidden states by training the model to make more accurate future predictions. We propose an auxiliary objective that serves as a regularization to improve generalization of the future frame prediction task. Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content.","{'sequence': 'Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech.

Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content.', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10519640147686005, 0.09402064979076385, 0.06843919306993484, 0.06402172893285751, 0.06260114163160324, 0.04992092028260231, 0.04783518612384796, 0.04688650369644165, 0.04580118507146835, 0.04369090124964714, 0.04140882194042206, 0.041289132088422775, 0.03600175678730011, 0.030433490872383118, 0.030001835897564888, 0.02966105006635189, 0.02885313332080841, 0.025840483605861664, 0.023922789841890335, 0.023211654275655746, 0.022866452112793922, 0.020672040060162544, 0.017423680052161217]}",0.10519640147686005,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.09402064979076385
Speech and Multimodality,Towards Emotion-aided Multi-modal Dialogue Act Classification,"The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively. But these studies limit themselves to text. Non-verbal features (change of tone, facial expressions etc.) can provide cues to identify DAs, thus stressing the benefit of incorporating multi-modal inputs in the task. Also, the emotional state of the speaker has a substantial effect on the choice of the dialogue act, since conversations are often influenced by emotions. Hence, the effect of emotion too on automatic identification of DAs needs to be studied. In this work, we address the role of both multi-modality and emotion recognition (ER) in DAC. DAC and ER help each other by way of multi-task learning. One of the major contributions of this work is a new dataset-multimodal Emotion aware Dialogue Act dataset called EMOTyDA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. To demonstrate the utility of EMOTyDA, we build an attention based (self, inter-modal, inter-task) multi-modal, multi-task Deep Neural Network (DNN) for joint learning of DAs and emotions. We show empirically that multimodality and multi-tasking achieve better performance of DAC compared to uni-modal and single task DAC variants. amounting to a total of 13708 utterances across the dataset. Each utterance is annotated for the presence of 7 emotions namely sadness, anger, fear, joy, surprise, disgust, and neutral.","{'sequence': 'The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively.

Summarization,Improving Truthfulness of Headline Generation,"Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries. However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of generated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in the source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline generation on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the stateof-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes generates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in untruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify the truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment of whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing untruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the untruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out untruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results demonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision data shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in automatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines.","{'sequence': 'Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries.

Summarization,Screenplay Summarization Using Latent Narrative Structure,"Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront. As a result, such models are biased by position and often perform a smart selection of sentences from the beginning of the document. When summarizing long narratives, which have complex structure and present information piecemeal, simple position heuristics are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose to explicitly incorporate the underlying structure of narratives into general unsupervised and supervised extractive summarization models. We formalize narrative structure in terms of key narrative events (turning points) and treat it as latent in order to summarize screenplays (i.e., extract an optimal sequence of scenes). Experimental results on the CSI corpus of TV screenplays, which we augment with scene-level summarization labels, show that latent turning points correlate with important aspects of a CSI episode and improve summarization performance over general extractive algorithms, leading to more complete and diverse summaries.","{'sequence': 'Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront.

Summarization,Knowledge Graph-Augmented Abstractive Summarization with Semantic-Driven Cloze Reward,"Sequence-to-sequence models for abstractive summarization have been studied extensively, yet the generated summaries commonly suffer from fabricated content, and are often found to be near-extractive. We argue that, to address these issues, the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, e.g., via structured representation, to allow the generation of more informative summaries. In this paper, we present ASGARD, a novel framework for Abstractive Summarization with Graph-Augmentation and semantic-driven RewarD. We propose the use of dual encoders-a sequential document encoder and a graphstructured encoder-to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities, complementing each other. We further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. Results show that our models produce significantly higher ROUGE scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both New York Times and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. We also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are finetuned from large pretrained language models. Human judges further rate our model outputs as more informative and containing fewer unfaithful errors. Input Article of New York Times: John M. Fabrizi, the mayor of Bridgeport, admitted on Tuesday that he had used cocaine and abused alcohol while in office. Mr. Fabrizi, who was appointed mayor in 2003 after the former mayor, Joseph P.

Summarization,"Attend, Translate and Summarize: An Efficient Method for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization","Cross-lingual summarization aims at summarizing a document in one language (e.g., Chinese) into another language (e.g., English). In this paper, we propose a novel method inspired by the translation pattern in the process of obtaining a cross-lingual summary. We first attend to some words in the source text, then translate them into the target language, and summarize to get the final summary. Specifically, we first employ the encoder-decoder attention distribution to attend to the source words. Second, we present three strategies to acquire the translation probability, which helps obtain the translation candidates for each source word. Finally, each summary word is generated either from the neural distribution or from the translation candidates of source words. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese summarization tasks have shown that our proposed method can significantly outperform the baselines, achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual summarization aims at summarizing a document in one language (e.g., Chinese) into another language (e.g., English).

Specifically, we first employ the encoder-decoder attention distribution to attend to the source words. Second, we present three strategies to acquire the translation probability, which helps obtain the translation candidates for each source word. Finally, each summary word is generated either from the neural distribution or from the translation candidates of source words. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese summarization tasks have shown that our proposed method can significantly outperform the baselines, achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.', 'labels': ['Summarization', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'NLP Applications', 'Question Answering', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.292203813791275, 0.09185703843832016, 0.049450527876615524, 0.04657521843910217, 0.045321062207221985, 0.045085832476615906, 0.039311207830905914, 0.039165277034044266, 0.035435307770967484, 0.031570255756378174, 0.02865886501967907, 0.028195638209581375, 0.02554289624094963, 0.02536105550825596, 0.025330323725938797, 0.024262353777885437, 0.023460613563656807, 0.021080931648612022, 0.02076476626098156, 0.018394039943814278, 0.018024181947112083, 0.014138905331492424, 0.010809899307787418]}",0.292203813791275,Summarization,0.292203813791275
Summarization,On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization,"It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria. 1 * The first two authors contributed equally. 1 Our human annotated summaries for faithfulness and factuality will be released at https://github.com/google-researchdatasets/xsum hallucination annotations.","{'sequence': 'It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation.

Summarization,Hooks in the Headline: Learning to Generate Headlines with Controlled Styles,"Current summarization systems only produce plain, factual headlines, but do not meet the practical needs of creating memorable titles to increase exposure.

We also introduced a novel parameter sharing scheme to further disentangle the style from the text. Through both automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that TitleStylist can generate relevant, fluent headlines with three target styles: humor, romance, and clickbait.

Summarization,SUPERT: Towards New Frontiers in Unsupervised Evaluation Metrics for Multi-Document Summarization,"We study unsupervised multi-document summarization evaluation metrics, which require neither human-written reference summaries nor human annotations (e.g. preferences, ratings, etc.).

Compared to the state-of-theart unsupervised evaluation metrics, SUPERT correlates better with human ratings by 18-39%.

Summarization,Unsupervised Opinion Summarization as Copycat-Review Generation,"Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews. While the majority of previous work has focused on the extractive setting, i.e., selecting fragments from input reviews to produce a summary, we let the model generate novel sentences and hence produce abstractive summaries. Recent progress in summarization has seen the development of supervised models which rely on large quantities of document-summary pairs. Since such training data is expensive to acquire, we instead consider the unsupervised setting, in other words, we do not use any summaries in training. We define a generative model for a review collection which capitalizes on the intuition that when generating a new review given a set of other reviews of a product, we should be able to control the ""amount of novelty"" going into the new review or, equivalently, vary the extent to which it deviates from the input. At test time, when generating summaries, we force the novelty to be minimal, and produce a text reflecting consensus opinions. We capture this intuition by defining a hierarchical variational autoencoder model. Both individual reviews and the products they correspond to are associated with stochastic latent codes, and the review generator (""decoder"") has direct access to the text of input reviews through the pointergenerator mechanism. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp datasets, show that setting at test time the review's latent code to its mean, allows the model to produce fluent and coherent summaries reflecting common opinions.","{'sequence': 'Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews.

Summarization,Jointly Learning to Align and Summarize for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization,"Cross-lingual summarization is the task of generating a summary in one language given a text in a different language. Previous works on cross-lingual summarization mainly focus on using pipeline methods or training an endto-end model using the translated parallel data.

In this paper, we propose to ease the cross-lingual summarization training by jointly learning to align and summarize. We design relevant loss functions to train this framework and propose several methods to enhance the isomorphism and cross-lingual transfer between languages.

Summarization,Extractive Summarization as Text Matching,"This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems. Instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably, this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset. Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework. We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To encourage more instantiations in the future, we have released our codes, processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in https://github. com/maszhongming/MatchSum.","{'sequence': 'This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems.

Summarization,Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual Consistency of Summaries,"Practical applications of abstractive summarization models are limited by frequent factual inconsistencies with respect to their input. Existing automatic evaluation metrics for summarization are largely insensitive to such errors. We propose QAGS, 1 an automatic evaluation protocol that is designed to identify factual inconsistencies in a generated summary. QAGS is based on the intuition that if we ask questions about a summary and its source, we will receive similar answers if the summary is factually consistent with the source. To evaluate QAGS, we collect human judgments of factual consistency on model-generated summaries for the CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) summarization datasets. QAGS has substantially higher correlations with these judgments than other automatic evaluation metrics. Also, QAGS offers a natural form of interpretability: The answers and questions generated while computing QAGS indicate which tokens of a summary are inconsistent and why. We believe QAGS is a promising tool in automatically generating usable and factually consistent text.

Summarization,Multi-Granularity Interaction Network for Extractive and Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization,"In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity interaction network for extractive and abstractive multi-document summarization, which jointly learn semantic representations for words, sentences, and documents.

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",Efficient Second-Order TreeCRF for Neural Dependency Parsing,"In the deep learning (DL) era, parsing models are extremely simplified with little hurt on performance, thanks to the remarkable capability of multi-layer BiLSTMs in context representation. As the most popular graphbased dependency parser due to its high efficiency and performance, the biaffine parser directly scores single dependencies under the arc-factorization assumption, and adopts a very simple local token-wise cross-entropy training loss. This paper for the first time presents a second-order TreeCRF extension to the biaffine parser. For a long time, the complexity and inefficiency of the inside-outside algorithm hinder the popularity of TreeCRF. To address this issue, we propose an effective way to batchify the inside and Viterbi algorithms for direct large matrix operation on GPUs, and to avoid the complex outside algorithm via efficient back-propagation. Experiments and analysis on 27 datasets from 13 languages clearly show that techniques developed before the DL era, such as structural learning (global TreeCRF loss) and high-order modeling are still useful, and can further boost parsing performance over the state-of-the-art biaffine parser, especially for partially annotated training data.

In this paper, we propose to reduce the gap between monolingual models and the unified multilingual model by distilling the structural knowledge of several monolingual models (teachers) to the unified multilingual model (student). We propose two novel KD methods based on structure-level information: (1) approximately minimizes the distance between the student's and the teachers' structurelevel probability distributions, (2) aggregates the structure-level knowledge to local distributions and minimizes the distance between two local probability distributions.

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing","Extracting Headless MWEs from Dependency Parse Trees: Parsing, Tagging, and Joint Modeling Approaches","An interesting and frequent type of multiword expression (MWE) is the headless MWE, for which there are no true internal syntactic dominance relations; examples include many named entities (""Wells Fargo"") and dates (""July 5, 2020"") as well as certain productive constructions (""blow for blow"", ""day after day""). Despite their special status and prevalence, current dependency-annotation schemes require treating such flat structures as if they had internal syntactic heads, and most current parsers handle them in the same fashion as headed constructions.

In particular, we highlight the importance of 1) a terminal edge-first parsing strategy, 2) a categorization of a subclass of HRG, i.e. what we call Weakly Regular Graph Grammar, and 3) distributing argumentstructures to both lexical and phrasal rules.', 'labels': ['Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.11682094633579254, 0.08257504552602768, 0.07421983778476715, 0.07069162279367447, 0.06909409165382385, 0.06823619455099106, 0.05807521939277649, 0.049021147191524506, 0.040673721581697464, 0.039499469101428986, 0.033890966325998306, 0.03273693099617958, 0.03131907433271408, 0.030223989859223366, 0.02884073741734028, 0.028435910120606422, 0.026892291381955147, 0.025623943656682968, 0.024821875616908073, 0.02036551758646965, 0.016873707994818687, 0.01588715799152851, 0.0151806166395545]}",0.11682094633579254,"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",0.11682094633579254
Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical),A Formal Hierarchy of RNN Architectures,"We develop a formal hierarchy of the expressive capacity of RNN architectures. The hierarchy is based on two formal properties: space complexity, which measures the RNN's memory, and rational recurrence, defined as whether the recurrent update can be described by a weighted finite-state machine. We place several RNN variants within this hierarchy. For example, we prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of ""saturated"" RNNs (Merrill, 2019) . While formally extending these findings to unsaturated RNNs is left to future work, we hypothesize that the practical learnable capacity of unsaturated RNNs obeys a similar hierarchy. Experimental findings from training unsaturated networks on formal languages support this conjecture. Proof. Choose k = 1. Fix the controller to push 1 for x t = a, and pop otherwise.","{'sequence': 'We develop a formal hierarchy of the expressive capacity of RNN architectures.
