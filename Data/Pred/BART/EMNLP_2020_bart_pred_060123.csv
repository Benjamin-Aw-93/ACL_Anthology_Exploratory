Computational Social Science and Social Media,Social Media Attributions in the Context of Water Crisis,"Attribution of natural disasters/collective misfortune is a widely-studied political science problem. However, such studies typically rely on surveys, expert opinions, or external signals such as voting outcomes. In this paper, we explore the viability of using unstructured, noisy social media data to complement traditional surveys through automatically extracting attribution factors. We present a novel prediction task of attribution tie detection of identifying the factors (e.g., poor city planning, exploding population etc.) held responsible for the crisis in a social media document. We focus on the 2019 Chennai water crisis that rapidly escalated into a discussion topic with global importance following alarming water-crisis statistics. On a challenging data set constructed from YouTube comments (72,098 comments posted by 43,859 users on 623 videos relevant to the crisis), we present a neural baseline to identify attribution ties that achieves a reasonable performance (accuracy: 87.34% on attribution detection and 81.37% on attribution resolution). We release the first annotated data set of 2,500 comments in this important domain 1 .","{'sequence': 'Attribution of natural disasters/collective misfortune is a widely-studied political science problem.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,An Embedding Model for Estimating Legislative Preferences from the Frequency and Sentiment of Tweets,"Legislator preferences are typically represented as measures of general ideology estimated from roll call votes on legislation, potentially masking important nuances in legislators' political attitudes. In this paper we introduce a method of measuring more specific legislator attitudes using an alternative expression of preferences: tweeting. Specifically, we present an embedding-based model for predicting the frequency and sentiment of legislator tweets. To illustrate our method, we model legislators' attitudes towards President Donald Trump as vector embeddings that interact with embeddings for Trump himself constructed using a neural network from the text of his daily tweets. We demonstrate the predictive performance of our model on tweets authored by members of the U.S. House and Senate related to the president from November 2016 to February 2018. We further assess the quality of our learned representations for legislators by comparing to traditional measures of legislator preferences.","{'sequence': ""Legislator preferences are typically represented as measures of general ideology estimated from roll call votes on legislation, potentially masking important nuances in legislators' political attitudes.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,A Computational Approach to Understanding Empathy Expressed in Text-Based Mental Health Support,"Empathy is critical to successful mental health support. Empathy measurement has predominantly occurred in synchronous, face-toface settings, and may not translate to asynchronous, text-based contexts. Because millions of people use text-based platforms for mental health support, understanding empathy in these contexts is crucial. In this work, we present a computational approach to understanding how empathy is expressed in online mental health platforms. We develop a novel unifying theoretically-grounded framework for characterizing the communication of empathy in text-based conversations. We collect and share a corpus of 10k (post, response) pairs annotated using this empathy framework with supporting evidence for annotations (rationales). We develop a multi-task RoBERTa-based bi-encoder model for identifying empathy in conversations and extracting rationales underlying its predictions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively identify empathic conversations. We further apply this model to analyze 235k mental health interactions and show that users do not self-learn empathy over time, revealing opportunities for empathy training and feedback.","{'sequence': 'Empathy is critical to successful mental health support.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,HENIN: Learning Heterogeneous Neural Interaction Networks for Explainable Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media,"In the computational detection of cyberbullying, existing work largely focused on building generic classifiers that rely exclusively on text analysis of social media sessions. Despite their empirical success, we argue that a critical missing piece is the model explainability, i.e., why a particular piece of media session is detected as cyberbullying. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel deep model, HEterogeneous Neural Interaction Networks (HENIN), for explainable cyberbullying detection. HENIN contains the following components: a comment encoder, a post-comment co-attention sub-network, and session-session and post-post interaction extractors. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets exhibit not only the promising performance of HENIN, but also highlight evidential comments so that one can understand why a media session is identified as cyberbullying.","{'sequence': 'In the computational detection of cyberbullying, existing work largely focused on building generic classifiers that rely exclusively on text analysis of social media sessions.

However, not all condolence is equal-trite responses offer little actual support despite their good intentions. Here, we develop computational tools to create a massive dataset of 11.4M expressions of distress and 2.8M corresponding offerings of condolence in order to examine the dynamics of condolence online. Our study reveals widespread disparity in what types of distress receive supportive condolence rather than just engagement. Building on studies from social psychology, we analyze the language of condolence and develop a new dataset for quantifying the empathy in a condolence using appraisal theory. Finally, we demonstrate that the features of condolence individuals find most helpful online differ substantially in their features from those seen in interpersonal settings.","{'sequence': ""Offering condolence is a natural reaction to hearing someone's distress.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Named Entity Recognition for Social Media Texts with Semantic Augmentation,"Existing approaches for named entity recognition suffer from data sparsity problems when conducted on short and informal texts, especially user-generated social media content. Semantic augmentation is a potential way to alleviate this problem. Given that rich semantic information is implicitly preserved in pre-trained word embeddings, they are potential ideal resources for semantic augmentation. In this paper, we propose a neural-based approach to NER for social media texts where both local (from running text) and augmented semantics are taken into account. In particular, we obtain the augmented semantic information from a large-scale corpus, and propose an attentive semantic augmentation module and a gate module to encode and aggregate such information, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets collected from English and Chinese social media platforms, where the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to previous studies across all three datasets. 1 * Equal contribution.","{'sequence': 'Existing approaches for named entity recognition suffer from data sparsity problems when conducted on short and informal texts, especially user-generated social media content.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Multilingual Offensive Language Identification with Cross-lingual Embeddings,"Offensive content is pervasive in social media and a reason for concern to companies and government organizations. Several studies have been recently published investigating methods to detect the various forms of such content (e.g. hate speech, cyberbulling, and cyberaggression). The clear majority of these studies deal with English partially because most annotated datasets available contain English data. In this paper, we take advantage of English data available by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and transfer learning to make predictions in languages with less resources.

Through analyzing a dataset of 80.5M questions across social media, books, and films, we show that individuals employ interpersonal pragmatic moves in their language to align their intimacy with social settings.

Our work demonstrates that intimacy is a pervasive and impactful social dimension of language."", 'labels': ['Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1848093718290329, 0.0876811295747757, 0.08180440962314606, 0.057713042944669724, 0.055437907576560974, 0.0493970587849617, 0.04786253720521927, 0.04320288076996803, 0.040923576802015305, 0.03543578460812569, 0.03323129564523697, 0.03169091045856476, 0.029846327379345894, 0.029402725398540497, 0.029062293469905853, 0.027707291767001152, 0.022684678435325623, 0.02262699045240879, 0.021060707047581673, 0.020775869488716125, 0.020632993429899216, 0.014189000241458416, 0.012821153737604618]}",0.1848093718290329,Discourse and Pragmatics,0.0876811295747757
Computational Social Science and Social Media,Where Are the Facts? Searching for Fact-checked Information to Alleviate the Spread of Fake News,"Although many fact-checking systems have been developed in academia and industry, fake news is still proliferating on social media. These systems mostly focus on fact-checking but usually neglect online users who are the main drivers of the spread of misinformation. How can we use fact-checked information to improve users' consciousness of fake news to which they are exposed? How can we stop users from spreading fake news? To tackle these questions, we propose a novel framework to search for fact-checking articles, which address the content of an original tweet (that may contain misinformation) posted by online users. The search can directly warn fake news posters and online users (e.g. the posters' followers) about misinformation, discourage them from spreading fake news, and scale up verified content on social media. Our framework uses both text and images to search for fact-checking articles, and achieves promising results on real-world datasets.

We also contrast the performance of these pretrained methods that can be used in an off-the-shelf (OTS) manner against a set of models trained on minimal custom data.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Social Chemistry 101: Learning to Reason about Social and Moral Norms,"Social norms-the unspoken commonsense rules about acceptable social behavior-are crucial in understanding the underlying causes and intents of people's actions in narratives. For example, underlying an action such as ""wanting to call cops on my neighbor"" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ""It is expected that you report crimes."" We present SOCIAL CHEMISTRY, a new conceptual formalism to study people's everyday social norms and moral judgments over a rich spectrum of real life situations described in natural language. We introduce SOCIAL-CHEM-101, a large-scale corpus that catalogs 292k rules-of-thumb such as ""It is rude to run a blender at 5am"" as the basic conceptual units. Each rule-of-thumb is further broken down with 12 different dimensions of people's judgments, including social judgments of good and bad, moral foundations, expected cultural pressure, and assumed legality, which together amount to over 4.5 million annotations of categorical labels and free-text descriptions. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models demonstrate that computational modeling of social norms is a promising research direction. Our model framework, NEURAL NORM TRANSFORMER, learns and generalizes SOCIAL-CHEM-101 to successfully reason about previously unseen situations, generating relevant (and potentially novel) attribute-aware social rules-of-thumb. Punching a friend who stole from me. RoT 1: It is unacceptable to injure a person. RoT 2: People should not steal from others. RoT 3: It is bad to betray a friend.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Cross-Media Keyphrase Prediction: A Unified Framework with Multi-Modality Multi-Head Attention and Image Wordings,"Social media produces large amounts of contents every day. To help users quickly capture what they need, keyphrase prediction is receiving a growing attention. Nevertheless, most prior efforts focus on text modeling, largely ignoring the rich features embedded in the matching images. In this work, we explore the joint effects of texts and images in predicting the keyphrases for a multimedia post. To better align social media style texts and images, we propose: (1) a novel Multi-Modality Multi-Head Attention (M 3 H-Att) to capture the intricate cross-media interactions; (2) image wordings, in forms of optical characters and image attributes, to bridge the two modalities. Moreover, we design a novel unified framework to leverage the outputs of keyphrase classification and generation and couple their advantages. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset 1 newly collected from Twitter show that our model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art based on traditional co-attentions. Further analyses show that our multi-head attention is able to attend information from various aspects and boost classification or generation in diverse scenarios.","{'sequence': 'Social media produces large amounts of contents every day.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our systems establish new state-of-the-art results on end-to-end response generation, 2) MinTL-based systems are more robust than baseline methods in the low resource setting, and they achieve competitive results with only 20% training data, and 3) Lev greatly improves the inference efficiency 1 .', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'NLP Applications', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1342596858739853, 0.11699261516332626, 0.09262879937887192, 0.057370372116565704, 0.05035095661878586, 0.04885406419634819, 0.03952104598283768, 0.03843264281749725, 0.03664011135697365, 0.03528458625078201, 0.035141170024871826, 0.03470350429415703, 0.033440832048654556, 0.031434204429388046, 0.028907356783747673, 0.027079753577709198, 0.026138300076127052, 0.02579512447118759, 0.025738639757037163, 0.024258483201265335, 0.02181084454059601, 0.018429342657327652, 0.016787592321634293]}",0.1342596858739853,Resources and Evaluation,0.11699261516332626

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Incremental Processing in the Age of Non-Incremental Encoders: An Empirical Assessment of Bidirectional Models for Incremental NLU,"While humans process language incrementally, the best language encoders currently used in NLP do not. Both bidirectional LSTMs and Transformers assume that the sequence that is to be encoded is available in full, to be processed either forwards and backwards (BiL-STMs) or as a whole (Transformers). We investigate how they behave under incremental interfaces, when partial output must be provided based on partial input seen up to a certain time step, which may happen in interactive systems. We test five models on various NLU datasets and compare their performance using three incremental evaluation metrics. The results support the possibility of using bidirectional encoders in incremental mode while retaining most of their non-incremental quality. The ""omni-directional"" BERT model, which achieves better non-incremental performance, is impacted more by the incremental access. This can be alleviated by adapting the training regime (truncated training), or the testing procedure, by delaying the output until some right context is available or by incorporating hypothetical right contexts generated by a language model like GPT-2.","{'sequence': 'While humans process language incrementally, the best language encoders currently used in NLP do not.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Few-Shot Intent Detection by Transferring Natural Language Inference,"Intent detection is one of the core components of goal-oriented dialog systems, and detecting out-of-scope (OOS) intents is also a practically important skill. Few-shot learning is attracting much attention to mitigate data scarcity, but OOS detection becomes even more challenging. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, discriminative nearest neighbor classification with deep self-attention. Unlike softmax classifiers, we leverage BERTstyle pairwise encoding to train a binary classifier that estimates the best matched training example for a user input. We propose to boost the discriminative ability by transferring a natural language inference (NLI) model. Our extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-domain intent detection task show that our method achieves more stable and accurate in-domain and OOS detection accuracy than RoBERTa-based classifiers and embeddingbased nearest neighbor approaches. More notably, the NLI transfer enables our 10-shot model to perform competitively with 50-shot or even full-shot classifiers, while we can keep the inference time constant by leveraging a faster embedding retrieval model.","{'sequence': 'Intent detection is one of the core components of goal-oriented dialog systems, and detecting out-of-scope (OOS) intents is also a practically important skill.

However, they are not directly applicable to dialogue systems because they are likely to force dialogue models to generate similar responses for different genders.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,AttnIO: Knowledge Graph Exploration with In-and-Out Attention Flow for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue,"Retrieving the proper knowledge relevant to conversational context is an important challenge in dialogue systems, to engage users with more informative response. Several recent works propose to formulate this knowledge selection problem as a path traversal over an external knowledge graph (KG), but show only a limited utilization of KG structure, leaving rooms of improvement in performance. To this effect, we present AttnIO, a new dialog-conditioned path traversal model that makes a full use of rich structural information in KG based on two directions of attention flows. Through the attention flows, At-tnIO is not only capable of exploring a broad range of multi-hop knowledge paths, but also learns to flexibly adjust the varying range of plausible nodes and edges to attend depending on the dialog context. Empirical evaluations present a marked performance improvement of AttnIO compared to all baselines in OpenDi-alKG dataset. Also, we find that our model can be trained to generate an adequate knowledge path even when the paths are not available and only the destination nodes are given as label, making it more applicable to real-world dialogue systems.","{'sequence': 'Retrieving the proper knowledge relevant to conversational context is an important challenge in dialogue systems, to engage users with more informative response.

Also, we find that our model can be trained to generate an adequate knowledge path even when the paths are not available and only the destination nodes are given as label, making it more applicable to real-world dialogue systems.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Question Answering', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09565277397632599, 0.09188879281282425, 0.0822838619351387, 0.07190761715173721, 0.06317564100027084, 0.04845472052693367, 0.04803374037146568, 0.04754960164427757, 0.03929661214351654, 0.03906449303030968, 0.03723527491092682, 0.036915410310029984, 0.0347699336707592, 0.03397337347269058, 0.032302506268024445, 0.03048008494079113, 0.029926583170890808, 0.028250668197870255, 0.02821691520512104, 0.026304984465241432, 0.02392273209989071, 0.01831970177590847, 0.012074004858732224]}",0.09565277397632599,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.09565277397632599
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Supervised Seeded Iterated Learning for Interactive Language Learning,"Language drift has been one of the major obstacles to train language models through interaction. When word-based conversational agents are trained towards completing a task, they tend to invent their language rather than leveraging natural language. In recent literature, two general methods partially counter this phenomenon: Supervised Selfplay (S2P) and Seeded Iterated Learning (SIL). While S2P jointly trains interactive and supervised losses to counter the drift, SIL changes the training dynamics to prevent language drift from occurring. In this paper, we first highlight their respective weaknesses, i.e., latestage training collapses and higher negative likelihood when evaluated on human corpus. Given these observations, we introduce Supervised Seeded Iterated Learning (SSIL) to combine both methods to minimize their respective weaknesses. We then show the effectiveness of SSIL in the language-drift translation game.","{'sequence': 'Language drift has been one of the major obstacles to train language models through interaction.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning a Simple and Effective Model for Multi-turn Response Generation with Auxiliary Tasks,"We study multi-turn response generation for open-domain dialogues. The existing state-ofthe-art addresses the problem with deep neural architectures. While these models improved response quality, their complexity also hinders the application of the models in real systems. In this work, we pursue a model that has a simple structure yet can effectively leverage conversation contexts for response generation. To this end, we propose four auxiliary tasks including word order recovery, utterance order recovery, masked word recovery, and masked utterance recovery, and optimize the objectives of these tasks together with maximizing the likelihood of generation. By this means, the auxiliary tasks that relate to context understanding can guide the learning of the generation model to achieve a better local optimum. Empirical studies with three benchmarks indicate that our model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generation models in terms of response quality on both automatic evaluation and human judgment, and at the same time enjoys a much faster decoding process.","{'sequence': 'We study multi-turn response generation for open-domain dialogues.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Bridging the Gap between Prior and Posterior Knowledge Selection for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation,"Knowledge selection plays an important role in knowledge-grounded dialogue, which is a challenging task to generate more informative responses by leveraging external knowledge. Recently, latent variable models have been proposed to deal with the diversity of knowledge selection by using both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge and achieve promising performance. However, these models suffer from a huge gap between prior and posterior knowledge selection. Firstly, the prior selection module may not learn to select knowledge properly because of lacking the necessary posterior information. Secondly, latent variable models suffer from the exposure bias that dialogue generation is based on the knowledge selected from the posterior distribution at training but from the prior distribution at inference. Here, we deal with these issues on two aspects: (1) We enhance the prior selection module with the necessary posterior information obtained from the specially designed Posterior Information Prediction Module (PIPM); (2) We propose a Knowledge Distillation Based Training Strategy (KDBTS) to train the decoder with the knowledge selected from the prior distribution, removing the exposure bias of knowledge selection. Experimental results on two knowledge-grounded dialogue datasets show that both PIPM and KDBTS achieve performance improvement over the state-of-theart latent variable model and their combination shows further improvement.","{'sequence': 'Knowledge selection plays an important role in knowledge-grounded dialogue, which is a challenging task to generate more informative responses by leveraging external knowledge.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Like hiking? You probably enjoy nature: Persona-grounded Dialog with Commonsense Expansions,"Existing persona-grounded dialog models often fail to capture simple implications of given persona descriptions, something which humans are able to do seamlessly. For example, state-of-the-art models cannot infer that interest in hiking might imply love for nature or longing for a break. In this paper, we propose to expand available persona sentences using existing commonsense knowledge bases and paraphrasing resources to imbue dialog models with access to an expanded and richer set of persona descriptions. Additionally, we introduce fine-grained grounding on personas by encouraging the model to make a discrete choice among persona sentences while synthesizing a dialog response. Since such a choice is not observed in the data, we model it using a discrete latent random variable and use variational learning to sample from hundreds of persona expansions. Our model outperforms competitive baselines on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset in terms of dialog quality and diversity while achieving persona-consistent and controllable dialog generation.","{'sequence': 'Existing persona-grounded dialog models often fail to capture simple implications of given persona descriptions, something which humans are able to do seamlessly.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Regularizing Dialogue Generation by Imitating Implicit Scenarios,"Human dialogues are scenario-based and appropriate responses generally relate to the latent context knowledge entailed by the specific scenario. To enable responses that are more meaningful and context-specific, we propose to improve generative dialogue systems from the scenario perspective, where both dialogue history and future conversation are taken into account to implicitly reconstruct the scenario knowledge. More importantly, the conversation scenarios are further internalized using imitation learning framework, where the conventional dialogue model that has no access to future conversations is effectively regularized by transferring the scenario knowledge contained in hierarchical supervising signals from the scenario-based dialogue model, so that the future conversation is not required in actual inference. Extensive evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-theart baselines on diversity and relevance, and expresses scenario-specific knowledge.","{'sequence': 'Human dialogues are scenario-based and appropriate responses generally relate to the latent context knowledge entailed by the specific scenario.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Spot The Bot: A Robust and Efficient Framework for the Evaluation of Conversational Dialogue Systems,"The lack of time-efficient and reliable evaluation methods hamper the development of conversational dialogue systems (chatbots). Evaluations requiring humans to converse with chatbots are time and cost-intensive, put high cognitive demands on the human judges, and yield low-quality results. In this work, we introduce Spot The Bot, a cost-efficient and robust evaluation framework that replaces human-bot conversations with conversations between bots. Human judges then only annotate for each entity in a conversation whether they think it is human or not (assuming there are humans participants in these conversations). These annotations then allow us to rank chatbots regarding their ability to mimic the conversational behavior of humans. Since we expect that all bots are eventually recognized as such, we incorporate a metric that measures which chatbot can uphold human-like behavior the longest, i.e., Survival Analysis. This metric has the ability to correlate a bot's performance to certain of its characteristics (e.g., fluency or sensibleness), yielding interpretable results. The comparably low cost of our framework allows for frequent evaluations of chatbots during their evaluation cycle. We empirically validate our claims by applying Spot The Bot to three domains, evaluating several stateof-the-art chatbots, and drawing comparisons to related work. The framework is released as a ready-to-use tool.","{'sequence': ""The lack of time-efficient and reliable evaluation methods hamper the development of conversational dialogue systems (chatbots).

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Personal Information Leakage Detection in Conversations,"The global market size of conversational assistants (chatbots) is expected to grow to USD 9.4 billion by 2024, according to Marketsand-Markets. Despite the wide use of chatbots, leakage of personal information through chatbots poses serious privacy concerns for their users. In this work, we propose to protect personal information by warning users of detected suspicious sentences generated by conversational assistants. The detection task is formulated as an alignment optimization problem and a new dataset PERSONA-LEAKAGE is collected for evaluation. In this paper, we propose two novel constrained alignment models, which consistently outperform baseline methods on PERSONA-LEAKAGE 1 . Moreover, we conduct analysis on the behavior of recently proposed personalized chit-chat dialogue systems.

Despite the wide use of chatbots, leakage of personal information through chatbots poses serious privacy concerns for their users. In this work, we propose to protect personal information by warning users of detected suspicious sentences generated by conversational assistants. The detection task is formulated as an alignment optimization problem and a new dataset PERSONA-LEAKAGE is collected for evaluation. In this paper, we propose two novel constrained alignment models, which consistently outperform baseline methods on PERSONA-LEAKAGE 1 . Moreover, we conduct analysis on the behavior of recently proposed personalized chit-chat dialogue systems.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,UniConv: A Unified Conversational Neural Architecture for Multi-domain Task-oriented Dialogues,"Building an end-to-end conversational agent for multi-domain task-oriented dialogues has been an open challenge for two main reasons. First, tracking dialogue states of multiple domains is non-trivial as the dialogue agent must obtain complete states from all relevant domains, some of which might have shared slots among domains as well as unique slots specifically for one domain only. Second, the dialogue agent must also process various types of information across domains, including dialogue context, dialogue states, and database, to generate natural responses to users. Unlike the existing approaches that are often designed to train each module separately, we propose ""UniConv"" -a novel unified neural architecture for end-to-end conversational systems in multi-domain task-oriented dialogues, which is designed to jointly train (i) a Bi-level State Tracker which tracks dialogue states by learning signals at both slot and domain level independently, and (ii) a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator which incorporates information from various input components and models dialogue acts and target responses simultaneously. We conduct comprehensive experiments in dialogue state tracking, contextto-text, and end-to-end settings on the Multi-WOZ2.1 benchmark, achieving superior performance over competitive baselines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Towards Persona-Based Empathetic Conversational Models,"Empathetic conversational models have been shown to improve user satisfaction and task outcomes in numerous domains. In Psychology, persona has been shown to be highly correlated to personality, which in turn influences empathy.

To this end, we propose a new task towards persona-based empathetic conversations and present the first empirical study on the impact of persona on empathetic responding. Specifically, we first present a novel large-scale multi-domain dataset for persona-based empathetic conversations. We then propose CoBERT, an efficient BERT-based response selection model that obtains the state-of-the-art performance on our dataset.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dialogue Distillation: Open-Domain Dialogue Augmentation Using Unpaired Data,"Recent advances in open-domain dialogue systems rely on the success of neural models that are trained on large-scale data. However, collecting large-scale dialogue data is usually time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this data dilemma, we propose a novel data augmentation method for training opendomain dialogue models by utilizing unpaired data. Specifically, a data-level distillation process is first proposed to construct augmented dialogues where both post and response are retrieved from the unpaired data. A ranking module is employed to filter out low-quality dialogues. Further, a model-level distillation process is employed to distill a teacher model trained on high-quality paired data to augmented dialogue pairs, thereby preventing dialogue models from being affected by the noise in the augmented data. Automatic and manual evaluation indicates that our method can produce high-quality dialogue pairs with diverse contents, and the proposed data-level and model-level dialogue distillation can improve the performance of competitive baselines.","{'sequence': 'Recent advances in open-domain dialogue systems rely on the success of neural models that are trained on large-scale data.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,GRADE: Automatic Graph-Enhanced Coherence Metric for Evaluating Open-Domain Dialogue Systems,"Automatically evaluating dialogue coherence is a challenging but high-demand ability for developing high-quality open-domain dialogue systems. However, current evaluation metrics consider only surface features or utterancelevel semantics, without explicitly considering the fine-grained topic transition dynamics of dialogue flows. Here, we first consider that the graph structure constituted with topics in a dialogue can accurately depict the underlying communication logic, which is a more natural way to produce persuasive metrics. Capitalized on the topic-level dialogue graph, we propose a new evaluation metric GRADE, which stands for Graph-enhanced Representations for Automatic Dialogue Evaluation. Specifically, GRADE incorporates both coarsegrained utterance-level contextualized representations and fine-grained topic-level graph representations to evaluate dialogue coherence. The graph representations are obtained by reasoning over topic-level dialogue graphs enhanced with the evidence from a commonsense graph, including k-hop neighboring representations and hop-attention weights. Experimental results show that our GRADE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art metrics on measuring diverse dialogue models in terms of the Pearson and Spearman correlations with human judgements.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Response Selection for Multi-Party Conversations with Dynamic Topic Tracking,"While participants in a multi-party multi-turn conversation simultaneously engage in multiple conversation topics, existing response selection methods are developed mainly focusing on a two-party single-conversation scenario. Hence, the prolongation and transition of conversation topics are ignored by current methods. In this work, we frame response selection as a dynamic topic tracking task to match the topic between the response and relevant conversation context. With this new formulation, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that supports efficient encoding through large pretrained models with only two utterances at once to perform dynamic topic disentanglement and response selection. We also propose Topic-BERT an essential pretraining step to embed topic information into BERT with self-supervised learning. Experimental results on the DSTC-8 Ubuntu IRC dataset show state-of-the-art results in response selection and topic disentanglement tasks outperforming existing methods by a good margin. 1","{'sequence': 'While participants in a multi-party multi-turn conversation simultaneously engage in multiple conversation topics, existing response selection methods are developed mainly focusing on a two-party single-conversation scenario.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,BiST: Bi-directional Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Video-Grounded Dialogues,"Video-grounded dialogues are very challenging due to (i) the complexity of videos which contain both spatial and temporal variations, and (ii) the complexity of user utterances which query different segments and/or different objects in videos over multiple dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to video-grounded dialogues often focus on superficial temporal-level visual cues, but neglect more fine-grained spatial signals from videos. To address this drawback, we propose Bi-directional Spatio-Temporal Learning (BiST), a vision-language neural framework for high-resolution queries in videos based on textual cues. Specifically, our approach not only exploits both spatial and temporal-level information, but also learns dynamic information diffusion between the two feature spaces through spatial-to-temporal and temporal-tospatial reasoning. The bidirectional strategy aims to tackle the evolving semantics of user queries in the dialogue setting. The retrieved visual cues are used as contextual information to construct relevant responses to the users. Our empirical results and comprehensive qualitative analysis show that BiST achieves competitive performance and generates reasonable responses on a large-scale AVSD benchmark. We also adapt our BiST models to the Video QA setting, and substantially outperform prior approaches on the TGIF-QA benchmark.","{'sequence': 'Video-grounded dialogues are very challenging due to (i) the complexity of videos which contain both spatial and temporal variations, and (ii) the complexity of user utterances which query different segments and/or different objects in videos over multiple dialogue turns.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Filtering Noisy Dialogue Corpora by Connectivity and Content Relatedness,"Large-scale dialogue datasets have recently become available for training neural dialogue agents. However, these datasets have been reported to contain a non-negligible number of unacceptable utterance pairs. In this paper, we propose a method for scoring the quality of utterance pairs in terms of their connectivity and relatedness. The proposed scoring method is designed based on findings widely shared in the dialogue and linguistics research communities. We demonstrate that it has a relatively good correlation with the human judgment of dialogue quality. Furthermore, the method is applied to filter out potentially unacceptable utterance pairs from a large-scale noisy dialogue corpus to ensure its quality.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Compositional Task-Oriented Semantic Parsing,"Task-oriented semantic parsing is a critical component of virtual assistants, which is responsible for understanding the user's intents (set reminder, play music, etc.). Recent advances in deep learning have enabled several approaches to successfully parse more complex queries (Gupta et al., 2018; Rongali et al., 2020) , but these models require a large amount of annotated training data to parse queries on new domains (e.g. reminder, music). In this paper, we focus on adapting taskoriented semantic parsers to low-resource domains, and propose a novel method that outperforms a supervised neural model at a 10-fold data reduction. In particular, we identify two fundamental factors for low-resource domain adaptation: better representation learning and better training techniques. Our representation learning uses BART (Lewis et al., 2020)   to initialize our model which outperforms encoder-only pre-trained representations used in previous work. Furthermore, we train with optimization-based meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017) to improve generalization to lowresource domains.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Human-centric dialog training via offline reinforcement learning,"How can we train a dialog model to produce better conversations by learning from human feedback, without the risk of humans teaching it harmful chat behaviors? We start by hosting models online, and gather human feedback from real-time, open-ended conversations, which we then use to train and improve the models using offline reinforcement learning (RL). We identify implicit conversational cues including language similarity, elicitation of laughter, sentiment, and more, which indicate positive human feedback, and embed these in multiple reward functions. A wellknown challenge is that learning an RL policy in an offline setting usually fails due to the lack of ability to explore and the tendency to make over-optimistic estimates of future reward. These problems become even harder when using RL for language models, which can easily have a 20,000 action vocabulary and many possible reward functions. We solve the challenge by developing a novel class of offline RL algorithms. These algorithms use KL-control to penalize divergence from a pretrained prior language model, and use a new strategy to make the algorithm pessimistic, instead of optimistic, in the face of uncertainty. We test the resulting dialog model with ratings from 80 users in an open-domain setting and find it achieves significant improvements over existing deep offline RL approaches. The novel offline RL method is viable for improving any existing generative dialog model using a static dataset of human feedback.","{'sequence': 'How can we train a dialog model to produce better conversations by learning from human feedback, without the risk of humans teaching it harmful chat behaviors?

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Amalgamating Knowledge from Two Teachers for Task-oriented Dialogue System with Adversarial Training,"The challenge of both achieving task completion by querying the knowledge base and generating human-like responses for task-oriented dialogue systems is attracting increasing research attention. In this paper, we propose a ""Two-Teacher One-Student"" learning framework (TTOS) for task-oriented dialogue, with the goal of retrieving accurate KB entities and generating human-like responses simultaneously. TTOS amalgamates knowledge from two teacher networks that together provide comprehensive guidance to build a highquality task-oriented dialogue system (student network). Each teacher network is trained via reinforcement learning with a goal-specific reward, which can be viewed as an expert towards the goal and transfers the professional characteristic to the student network. Instead of adopting the classic student-teacher learning of forcing the output of a student network to exactly mimic the soft targets produced by the teacher networks, we introduce two discriminators as in generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer knowledge from two teachers to the student. The usage of discriminators relaxes the rigid coupling between the student and teachers. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., CamRest and In-Car Assistant) demonstrate that TTOS significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Currently, virtual assistants work in the paradigm of intentslot tagging and the slot values are directly passed as-is to the execution engine. However, this setup fails in some scenarios such as messaging when the query given by the user needs to be changed before repeating it or sending it to another user. For example, for queries like 'ask my wife if she can pick up the kids' or 'remind me to take my pills', we need to rephrase the content to 'can you pick up the kids' and 'take your pills'. In this paper, we study the problem of rephrasing with messaging as a use case and release a dataset of 3000 pairs of original query and rephrased query. We show that BART, a pre-trained transformers-based masked language model with auto-regressive decoding, is a strong baseline for the task, and show improvements by adding a copy-pointer and copy loss to it. We analyze different tradeoffs of BART-based and LSTM-based seq2seq models, and propose a distilled LSTM-based seq2seq as the best practical model.","{'sequence': ""We introduce a new task of rephrasing for a more natural virtual assistant.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Probabilistic End-To-End Task-Oriented Dialog Model with Latent Belief States towards Semi-Supervised Learning,"Structured belief states are crucial for user goal tracking and database query in task-oriented dialog systems. However, training belief trackers often requires expensive turn-level annotations of every user utterance. In this paper we aim at alleviating the reliance on belief state labels in building end-to-end dialog systems, by leveraging unlabeled dialog data towards semi-supervised learning. We propose a probabilistic dialog model, called the LAtent BElief State (LABES) model, where belief states are represented as discrete latent variables and jointly modeled with system responses given user inputs. Such latent variable modeling enables us to develop semi-supervised learning under the principled variational learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce LABES-S2S, which is a copyaugmented Seq2Seq model instantiation of LABES 1 . In supervised experiments, LABES-S2S obtains strong results on three benchmark datasets of different scales. In utilizing unlabeled dialog data, semi-supervised LABES-S2S significantly outperforms both supervisedonly and semi-supervised baselines. Remarkably, we can reduce the annotation demands to 50% without performance loss on MultiWOZ.","{'sequence': 'Structured belief states are crucial for user goal tracking and database query in task-oriented dialog systems.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Queens are Powerful too: Mitigating Gender Bias in Dialogue Generation,"Social biases present in data are often directly reflected in the predictions of models trained on that data. We analyze gender bias in dialogue data, and examine how this bias is not only replicated, but is also amplified in subsequent generative chit-chat dialogue models. We measure gender bias in six existing dialogue datasets before selecting the most biased one, the multi-player textbased fantasy adventure dataset LIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019), as a testbed for bias mitigation techniques. We consider three techniques to mitigate gender bias: counterfactual data augmentation, targeted data collection, and bias controlled training. We show that our proposed techniques mitigate gender bias by balancing the genderedness of generated dialogue utterances, and find that they are particularly effective in combination. We evaluate model performance with a variety of quantitative methods-including the quantity of gendered words, a dialogue safety classifier, and human assessments-all of which show that our models generate less gendered, but equally engaging chit-chat responses.","{'sequence': 'Social biases present in data are often directly reflected in the predictions of models trained on that data.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Improving Out-of-Scope Detection in Intent Classification by Using Embeddings of the Word Graph Space of the Classes,"This paper explores how intent classification can be improved by representing the class labels not as a discrete set of symbols but as a space where the word graphs associated to each class are mapped using typical graph embedding techniques. The approach, inspired by a previous algorithm used for an inverse dictionary task, allows the classification algorithm to take in account inter-class similarities provided by the repeated occurrence of some words in the training examples of the different classes. The classification is carried out by mapping text embeddings to the word graph embeddings of the classes. Focusing solely on improving the representation of the class label set, we show in experiments conducted in both private and public intent classification datasets, that better detection of out-of-scope examples (OOS) is achieved and, as a consequence, that the overall accuracy of intent classification is also improved. In particular, using the recently-released Larson dataset, an error of about 9.9% has been achieved for OOS detection, beating the previous state-of-the-art result by more than 31 percentage points.","{'sequence': 'This paper explores how intent classification can be improved by representing the class labels not as a discrete set of symbols but as a space where the word graphs associated to each class are mapped using typical graph embedding techniques.

In particular, using the recently-released Larson dataset, an error of about 9.9% has been achieved for OOS detection, beating the previous state-of-the-art result by more than 31 percentage points.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Information Extraction', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07493553310632706, 0.07442982494831085, 0.0660441592335701, 0.06229142099618912, 0.05637729912996292, 0.054581765085458755, 0.05452056974172592, 0.05341244488954544, 0.04781047999858856, 0.047289762645959854, 0.04267256334424019, 0.041003789752721786, 0.04045510292053223, 0.040173109620809555, 0.03976574167609215, 0.033321063965559006, 0.026863085106015205, 0.026514627039432526, 0.026385778561234474, 0.02610902115702629, 0.02539835311472416, 0.022749194875359535, 0.016895325854420662]}",0.07493553310632706,Question Answering,0.06229142099618912
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dialogue Response Ranking Training with Large-Scale Human Feedback Data,"Existing open-domain dialog models are generally trained to minimize the perplexity of target human responses. However, some human replies are more engaging than others, spawning more followup interactions. Current conversational models are increasingly capable of producing turns that are context-relevant, but in order to produce compelling agents, these models need to be able to predict and optimize for turns that are genuinely engaging. We leverage social media feedback data (number of replies and upvotes) to build a large-scale training dataset for feedback prediction. To alleviate possible distortion between the feedback and engagingness, we convert the ranking problem to a comparison of response pairs which involve few confounding factors. We trained DIALOGRPT, a set of GPT-2 based models on 133M pairs of human feedback data and the resulting ranker outperformed several baselines. Particularly, our ranker outperforms the conventional dialog perplexity baseline with a large margin on predicting Reddit feedback. We finally combine the feedback prediction models and a human-like scoring model to rank the machine-generated dialog responses. Crowd-sourced human evaluation shows that our ranking method correlates better with real human preferences than baseline models. 1","{'sequence': 'Existing open-domain dialog models are generally trained to minimize the perplexity of target human responses.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,The World is Not Binary: Learning to Rank with Grayscale Data for Dialogue Response Selection,"Response selection plays a vital role in building retrieval-based conversation systems. Despite that response selection is naturally a learning-to-rank problem, most prior works take a point-wise view and train binary classifiers for this task: each response candidate is labeled either relevant (one) or irrelevant (zero). On the one hand, this formalization can be sub-optimal due to its ignorance of the diversity of response quality. On the other hand, annotating grayscale data for learning-to-rank can be prohibitively expensive and challenging. In this work, we show that grayscale data can be automatically constructed without human effort. Our method employs off-the-shelf response retrieval models and response generation models as automatic grayscale data generators. With the constructed grayscale data, we propose multi-level ranking objectives for training, which can (1) teach a matching model to capture more fine-grained context-response relevance difference and (2) reduce the traintest discrepancy in terms of distractor strength. Our method is simple, effective, and universal.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Simple Data Augmentation with the Mask Token Improves Domain Adaptation for Dialog Act Tagging,"The concept of Dialogue Act (DA) is universal across different task-oriented dialogue domains -the act of ""request"" carries the same speaker intention whether it is for restaurant reservation or flight booking. However, DA taggers trained on one domain do not generalize well to other domains, which leaves us with the expensive need for a large amount of annotated data in the target domain. In this work, we investigate how to better adapt DA taggers to desired target domains with only unlabeled data. We propose MASKAUGMENT, a controllable mechanism that augments text input by leveraging the pre-trained MASK token from BERT model. Inspired by consistency regularization, we use MASKAUGMENT to introduce an unsupervised teacher-student learning scheme to examine the domain adaptation of DA taggers.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Will I Sound Like Me? Improving Persona Consistency in Dialogues through Pragmatic Self-Consciousness,"We explore the task of improving persona consistency of dialogue agents. Recent models tackling consistency often train with additional Natural Language Inference (NLI) labels or attach trained extra modules to the generative agent for maintaining consistency. However, such additional labels and training can be demanding. Also, we find even the bestperforming persona-based agents are insensitive to contradictory words. Inspired by social cognition and pragmatics, we endow existing dialogue agents with public self-consciousness on the fly through an imaginary listener. Our approach, based on the Rational Speech Acts framework (Frank and Goodman, 2012), can enforce dialogue agents to refrain from uttering contradiction. We further extend the framework by learning the distractor selection, which has been usually done manually or randomly. Results on Dialogue NLI (Welleck  et al., 2019)  and PersonaChat (Zhang et al.,  2018)  dataset show that our approach reduces contradiction and improves consistency of existing dialogue models. Moreover, we show that it can be generalized to improve contextconsistency beyond persona in dialogues.","{'sequence': 'We explore the task of improving persona consistency of dialogue agents.

Our approach, based on the Rational Speech Acts framework (Frank and Goodman, 2012), can enforce dialogue agents to refrain from uttering contradiction. We further extend the framework by learning the distractor selection, which has been usually done manually or randomly. Results on Dialogue NLI (Welleck  et al., 2019)  and PersonaChat (Zhang et al.,  2018)  dataset show that our approach reduces contradiction and improves consistency of existing dialogue models.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,RiSAWOZ: A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset with Rich Semantic Annotations for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modeling,"In order to alleviate the shortage of multidomain data and to capture discourse phenomena for task-oriented dialogue modeling, we propose RiSAWOZ, a large-scale multidomain Chinese Wizard-of-Oz dataset with Rich Semantic Annotations. RiSAWOZ contains 11.2K human-to-human (H2H) multiturn semantically annotated dialogues, with more than 150K utterances spanning over 12 domains, which is larger than all previous annotated H2H conversational datasets. Both single-and multi-domain dialogues are constructed, accounting for 65% and 35%, respectively. Each dialogue is labeled with comprehensive dialogue annotations, including dialogue goal in the form of natural language description, domain, dialogue states and acts at both the user and system side. In addition to traditional dialogue annotations, we especially provide linguistic annotations on discourse phenomena, e.g., ellipsis and coreference, in dialogues, which are useful for dialogue coreference and ellipsis resolution tasks. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a detailed description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis of the dataset. A series of benchmark models and results are reported, including natural language understanding (intent detection & slot filling), dialogue state tracking and dialogue contextto-text generation, as well as coreference and ellipsis resolution, which facilitate the baseline comparison for future research on this corpus. 1","{'sequence': 'In order to alleviate the shortage of multidomain data and to capture discourse phenomena for task-oriented dialogue modeling, we propose RiSAWOZ, a large-scale multidomain Chinese Wizard-of-Oz dataset with Rich Semantic Annotations.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Structured Attention for Unsupervised Dialogue Structure Induction,"Inducing a meaningful structural representation from one or a set of dialogues is a crucial but challenging task in computational linguistics. Advancement made in this area is critical for dialogue system design and discourse analysis. It can also be extended to solve grammatical inference. In this work, we propose to incorporate structured attention layers into a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) model with discrete latent states to learn dialogue structure in an unsupervised fashion. Compared to a vanilla VRNN, structured attention enables a model to focus on different parts of the source sentence embeddings while enforcing a structural inductive bias. Experiments show that on two-party dialogue datasets, VRNN with structured attention learns semantic structures that are similar to templates used to generate this dialogue corpus. While on multi-party dialogue datasets, our model learns an interactive structure demonstrating its capability of distinguishing speakers or addresses, automatically disentangling dialogues without explicit human annotation. 1","{'sequence': 'Inducing a meaningful structural representation from one or a set of dialogues is a crucial but challenging task in computational linguistics.

Different from the previous deep model-based reinforcement learning methods, which uses background planning and may suffer from low-quality simulated experiences, MCTS-DDU performs decision-time planning based on dialogue state search trees built by Monte Carlo simulations and is robust to the simulation errors. Such idea arises naturally in human behaviors, e.g. predicting others' responses and then deciding our own actions. In the simulated movie-ticket booking task, our method outperforms the background planning approaches significantly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MCTS and the dueling network in detailed ablation studies, and also compare the performance upper bounds of these two planning methods.","{'sequence': ""We introduce a framework of Monte Carlo Tree Search with Double-q Dueling network (MCTS-DDU) for task-completion dialogue policy learning.

To effectively leverage the structural information in dialogue history, we propose a new recurrent cell architecture which allows representation learning on graphs.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Online Conversation Disentanglement with Pointer Networks,"Huge amounts of textual conversations occur online every day, where multiple conversations take place concurrently. Interleaved conversations lead to difficulties in not only following the ongoing discussions but also extracting relevant information from simultaneous messages.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end online framework for conversation disentanglement that avoids time-consuming domain-specific feature engineering. We design a novel way to embed the whole utterance that comprises timestamp, speaker, and message text, and propose a custom attention mechanism that models disentanglement as a pointing problem while effectively capturing inter-utterance interactions in an end-to-end fashion.

Discourse and Pragmatics,MEGA RST Discourse Treebanks with Structure and Nuclearity from Scalable Distant Sentiment Supervision,"The lack of large and diverse discourse treebanks hinders the application of data-driven approaches, such as deep-learning, to RSTstyle discourse parsing.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Keeping Up Appearances: Computational Modeling of Face Acts in Persuasion Oriented Discussions,"The notion of face refers to the public selfimage of an individual that emerges both from the individual's own actions as well as from the interaction with others. Modeling face and understanding its state changes throughout a conversation is critical to the study of maintenance of basic human needs in and through interaction. Grounded in the politeness theory of Brown and Levinson (1978) , we propose a generalized framework for modeling face acts in persuasion conversations, resulting in a reliable coding manual, an annotated corpus, and computational models. The framework reveals insights about differences in face act utilization between asymmetric roles in persuasion conversations. Using computational models, we are able to successfully identify face acts as well as predict a key conversational outcome (e.g. donation success). Finally, we model a latent representation of the conversational state to analyze the impact of predicted face acts on the probability of a positive conversational outcome and observe several correlations that corroborate previous findings.","{'sequence': ""The notion of face refers to the public selfimage of an individual that emerges both from the individual's own actions as well as from the interaction with others.

We find that (i) sentence positional encodings can lead to a large improvement for identifying discourse elements; (ii) a structural relative positional encoding of sentences shows to be most effective; (iii) inter-sentence attention vectors are useful as a kind of sentence representation for identifying discourse elements.', 'labels': ['Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond'], 'scores': [0.08184925466775894, 0.08184496313333511, 0.06342142820358276, 0.054134223610162735, 0.051134902983903885, 0.050027064979076385, 0.049248285591602325, 0.04909279942512512, 0.048967864364385605, 0.04783945530653, 0.04487614706158638, 0.04464234411716461, 0.04217381030321121, 0.039931200444698334, 0.03775138035416603, 0.03747693821787834, 0.03746839985251427, 0.03221491724252701, 0.03181122988462448, 0.030235441401600838, 0.015764744952321053, 0.015231057070195675, 0.012862159870564938]}",0.08184925466775894,Discourse and Pragmatics,0.08184925466775894
Discourse and Pragmatics,PowerTransformer: Unsupervised Controllable Revision for Biased Language Correction,"Unconscious biases continue to be prevalent in modern text and media, calling for algorithms that can assist writers with bias correction. For example, a female character in a story is often portrayed as passive and powerless (""She daydreams about being a doctor"") while a man is portrayed as more proactive and powerful (""He pursues his dream of being a doctor""). We formulate Controllable Debiasing, a new revision task that aims to rewrite a given text to correct the implicit and potentially undesirable bias in character portrayals. We then introduce POWERTRANSFORMER as an approach that debiases text through the lens of connotation frames (Sap et al., 2017) , which encode pragmatic knowledge of implied power dynamics with respect to verb predicates. One key challenge of our task is the lack of parallel corpora. To address this challenge, we adopt an unsupervised approach using auxiliary supervision with related tasks such as paraphrasing and self-supervision based on a reconstruction loss, building on pretrained language models. Through comprehensive experiments based on automatic and human evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms ablations and existing methods from related tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of POWER-TRANSFORMER as a step toward mitigating the well-documented gender bias in character portrayal in movie scripts. Daniel Clement Dennett. 1989.

Information Extraction,Design Challenges in Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking,"Cross-lingual Entity Linking (XEL), the problem of grounding mentions of entities in a foreign language text into an English knowledge base such as Wikipedia, has seen a lot of research in recent years, with a range of promising techniques. However, current techniques do not rise to the challenges introduced by text in low-resource languages (LRL) and, surprisingly, fail to generalize to text not taken from Wikipedia, on which they are usually trained. This paper provides a thorough analysis of low-resource XEL techniques, focusing on the key step of identifying candidate English Wikipedia titles that correspond to a given foreign language mention. Our analysis indicates that current methods are limited by their reliance on Wikipedia's interlanguage links and thus suffer when the foreign language's Wikipedia is small. We conclude that the LRL setting requires the use of outside-Wikipedia cross-lingual resources and present a simple yet effective zero-shot XEL system, QuEL, that utilizes search engines query logs. With experiments on 25 languages, QuEL shows an average increase of 25% in gold candidate recall and of 13% in end-to-end linking accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. 1","{'sequence': ""Cross-lingual Entity Linking (XEL), the problem of grounding mentions of entities in a foreign language text into an English knowledge base such as Wikipedia, has seen a lot of research in recent years, with a range of promising techniques.

Information Extraction,Joint Constrained Learning for Event-Event Relation Extraction,"Understanding natural language involves recognizing how multiple event mentions structurally and temporally interact with each other. In this process, one can induce event complexes that organize multi-granular events with temporal order and membership relations interweaving among them. Due to the lack of jointly labeled data for these relational phenomena and the restriction on the structures they articulate, we propose a joint constrained learning framework for modeling event-event relations. Specifically, the framework enforces logical constraints within and across multiple temporal and subevent relations by converting these constraints into differentiable learning objectives. We show that our joint constrained learning approach effectively compensates for the lack of jointly labeled data, and outperforms SOTA methods on benchmarks for both temporal relation extraction and event hierarchy construction, replacing a commonly used but more expensive global inference process.

Information Extraction,Domain Knowledge Empowered Structured Neural Net for End-to-End Event Temporal Relation Extraction,"Extracting event temporal relations is a critical task for information extraction and plays an important role in natural language understanding. Prior systems leverage deep learning and pre-trained language models to improve the performance of the task. However, these systems often suffer from two shortcomings: 1) when performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference based on neural models, previous systems only used structured knowledge that is assumed to be absolutely correct, i.e., hard constraints; 2) biased predictions on dominant temporal relations when training with a limited amount of data. To address these issues, we propose a framework that enhances deep neural network with distributional constraints constructed by probabilistic domain knowledge. We solve the constrained inference problem via Lagrangian Relaxation and apply it to end-to-end event temporal relation extraction tasks. Experimental results show our framework is able to improve the baseline neural network models with strong statistical significance on two widely used datasets in news and clinical domains.","{'sequence': 'Extracting event temporal relations is a critical task for information extraction and plays an important role in natural language understanding.

However, these systems often suffer from two shortcomings: 1) when performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference based on neural models, previous systems only used structured knowledge that is assumed to be absolutely correct, i.e., hard constraints; 2) biased predictions on dominant temporal relations when training with a limited amount of data. To address these issues, we propose a framework that enhances deep neural network with distributional constraints constructed by probabilistic domain knowledge. We solve the constrained inference problem via Lagrangian Relaxation and apply it to end-to-end event temporal relation extraction tasks.

Information Extraction,Double Graph Based Reasoning for Document-level Relation Extraction,"Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations among entities within a document. Different from sentence-level relation extraction, it requires reasoning over multiple sentences across paragraphs.

The former captures complex interaction among different mentions and the latter aggregates mentions underlying for the same entities. Based on the graphs we propose a novel path reasoning mechanism to infer relations between entities. Experiments on the public dataset, DocRED, show GAIN achieves a significant performance improvement (2.85 on F1) over the previous state-of-the-art.

Information Extraction,Multimodal Joint Attribute Prediction and Value Extraction for E-commerce Product,"Product attribute values are essential in many e-commerce scenarios, such as customer service robots, product recommendations, and product retrieval. While in the real world, the attribute values of a product are usually incomplete and vary over time, which greatly hinders the practical applications. In this paper, we propose a multimodal method to jointly predict product attributes and extract values from textual product descriptions with the help of the product images. We argue that product attributes and values are highly correlated, e.g., it will be easier to extract the values on condition that the product attributes are given. Thus, we jointly model the attribute prediction and value extraction tasks from multiple aspects towards the interactions between attributes and values. Moreover, product images have distinct effects on our tasks for different product attributes and values. Thus, we selectively draw useful visual information from product images to enhance our model. We annotate a multimodal product attribute value dataset that contains 87,194 instances, and the experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that explicitly modeling the relationship between attributes and values facilitates our method to establish the correspondence between them, and selectively utilizing visual product information is necessary for the task.

Information Extraction,MAVEN: A Massive General Domain Event Detection Dataset,"Event detection (ED), which means identifying event trigger words and classifying event types, is the first and most fundamental step for extracting event knowledge from plain text. Most existing datasets exhibit the following issues that limit further development of ED: (1) Data scarcity. Existing smallscale datasets are not sufficient for training and stably benchmarking increasingly sophisticated modern neural methods. (2) Low coverage. Limited event types of existing datasets cannot well cover general-domain events, which restricts the applications of ED models. To alleviate these problems, we present a MAssive eVENt detection dataset (MAVEN), which contains 4, 480 Wikipedia documents, 118, 732 event mention instances, and 168 event types. MAVEN alleviates the data scarcity problem and covers much more general event types. We reproduce the recent state-of-the-art ED models and conduct a thorough evaluation on MAVEN. The experimental results show that existing ED methods cannot achieve promising results on MAVEN as on the small datasets, which suggests that ED in the real world remains a challenging task and requires further research efforts.

Information Extraction,Biomedical Event Extraction as Sequence Labeling,"We introduce Biomedical Event Extraction as Sequence Labeling (BEESL), a joint endto-end neural information extraction model. BEESL recasts the task as sequence labeling, taking advantage of a multi-label aware encoding strategy and jointly modeling the intermediate tasks via multi-task learning. BEESL is fast, accurate, end-to-end, and unlike current methods does not require any external knowledge base or preprocessing tools.

Information Extraction,Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning over Sparse Knowledge Graph,"Multi-hop reasoning has been widely studied in recent years to seek an effective and interpretable method for knowledge graph (KG) completion. Most previous reasoning methods are designed for dense KGs with enough paths between entities, but cannot work well on those sparse KGs that only contain sparse paths for reasoning. On the one hand, sparse KGs contain less information, which makes it difficult for the model to choose correct paths. On the other hand, the lack of evidential paths to target entities also makes the reasoning process difficult. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning model named DacKGR over sparse KGs, by applying novel dynamic anticipation and completion strategies: (1) The anticipation strategy utilizes the latent prediction of embeddingbased models to make our model perform more potential path search over sparse KGs. (2) Based on the anticipation information, the completion strategy dynamically adds edges as additional actions during the path search, which further alleviates the sparseness problem of KGs. The experimental results on five datasets sampled from Freebase, NELL and Wikidata show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We design two evaluation metrics, instance coverage and instance coherence, to evaluate the quality of graph schema induction, by checking when coherent event instances are covered by the schema graph. Intrinsic evaluations show that our approach is highly effective at inducing salient and coherent schemas.

Information Extraction,Scalable Zero-shot Entity Linking with Dense Entity Retrieval,"This paper introduces a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective BERT-based entity linking model, along with an extensive evaluation of its accuracy-speed trade-off. We present a two-stage zero-shot linking algorithm, where each entity is defined only by a short textual description. The first stage does retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions. Each candidate is then re-ranked with a crossencoder, that concatenates the mention and entity text. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is state of the art on recent zeroshot benchmarks (6 point absolute gains) and also on more established non-zero-shot evaluations (e.g. TACKBP-2010), despite its relative simplicity (e.g. no explicit entity embeddings or manually engineered mention tables).

We present a two-stage zero-shot linking algorithm, where each entity is defined only by a short textual description. The first stage does retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions. Each candidate is then re-ranked with a crossencoder, that concatenates the mention and entity text. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is state of the art on recent zeroshot benchmarks (6 point absolute gains) and also on more established non-zero-shot evaluations (e.g. TACKBP-2010), despite its relative simplicity (e.g. no explicit entity embeddings or manually engineered mention tables).

Information Extraction,Incremental Event Detection via Knowledge Consolidation Networks,"Conventional approaches to event detection usually require a fixed set of pre-defined event types. Such a requirement is often challenged in real-world applications, as new events continually occur. Due to huge computation cost and storage budge, it is infeasible to store all previous data and re-train the model with all previous data and new data, every time new events arrive. We formulate such challenging scenarios as incremental event detection, which requires a model to learn new classes incrementally without performance degradation on previous classes. However, existing incremental learning methods cannot handle semantic ambiguity and training data imbalance problems between old and new classes in the task of incremental event detection. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Consolidation Network (KCN) to address the above issues. Specifically, we devise two components, prototype enhanced retrospection and hierarchical distillation, to mitigate the adverse effects of semantic ambiguity and class imbalance, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 19% and 13.4% of whole F1 score on ACE benchmark and TAC KBP benchmark, respectively.","{'sequence': 'Conventional approaches to event detection usually require a fixed set of pre-defined event types.

Information Extraction,Understanding Procedural Text using Interactive Entity Networks,"The task of procedural text comprehension aims to understand the dynamic nature of entities/objects in a process. Here, the key is to track how the entities interact with each other and how their states are changing along the procedure. Recent efforts have made great progress to track multiple entities in a procedural text, but usually treat each entity separately and ignore the fact that there are often multiple entities interacting with each other during one process, some of which are even explicitly mentioned. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Entity Network (IEN), which is a recurrent network with memory equipped cells for state tracking. In each IEN cell, we maintain different attention matrices through specific memories to model different types of entity interactions. Importantly, we can update these memories in a sequential manner so as to explore the causal relationship between entity actions and subsequent state changes. We evaluate our model on a benchmark dataset, and the results show that IEN outperforms stateof-the-art models by precisely capturing the interactions of multiple entities and explicitly leverage the relationship between entity interactions and subsequent state changes.

Information Extraction,A Predicate-Function-Argument Annotation of Natural Language for Open-Domain Information eXpression,"Existing OIE (Open Information Extraction) algorithms are independent of each other such that there exist lots of redundant works; the featured strategies are not reusable and not adaptive to new tasks.

The OIX is an OIE friendly expression of a sentence without information loss. The generation procedure of OIX contains shared works of OIE algorithms so that OIE strategies can be developed on the platform of OIX as inference operations focusing on more critical problems. Based on the same platform of OIX, the OIE strategies are reusable, and people can select a set of strategies to assemble their algorithm for a specific task so that the adaptability may be significantly increased. This paper focuses on the task of OIX and propose a solution -Open Information Annotation (OIA). OIA is a predicate-function-argument annotation for sentences. We label a data set of sentence-OIA pairs and propose a dependency-based rule system to generate OIA annotations from sentences. The evaluation results reveal that learning the OIA from a sentence is a challenge owing to the complexity of natural language sentences, and it is worthy of attracting more attention from the research community.","{'sequence': 'Existing OIE (Open Information Extraction) algorithms are independent of each other such that there exist lots of redundant works; the featured strategies are not reusable and not adaptive to new tasks.

Information Extraction,Enhancing Aspect Term Extraction with Soft Prototypes,"Aspect term extraction (ATE) aims to extract aspect terms from a review sentence that users have expressed opinions on. Existing studies mostly focus on designing neural sequence taggers to extract linguistic features from the token level. However, since the aspect terms and context words usually exhibit long-tail distributions, these taggers often converge to an inferior state without enough sample exposure. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem by correlating words with each other through soft prototypes. These prototypes, generated by a soft retrieval process, can introduce global knowledge from internal or external data and serve as the supporting evidence for discovering the aspect terms. Our proposed model is a general framework and can be combined with almost all sequence taggers. Experiments on four SemEval datasets show that our model boosts the performance of three typical ATE methods by a large margin.","{'sequence': 'Aspect term extraction (ATE) aims to extract aspect terms from a review sentence that users have expressed opinions on.

In this paper, we work on a new task of semi-supervised event type induction, aiming to automatically discover a set of unseen types from a given corpus by leveraging annotations available for a few seen types. We design a Semi-Supervised Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder framework to automatically learn a discrete latent type representation for each seen and unseen type and optimize them using seen type event annotations. A variational autoencoder is further introduced to enforce the reconstruction of each event mention conditioned on its latent type distribution.

Information Extraction,Event Detection: Gate Diversity and Syntactic Importance Scores for Graph Convolution Neural Networks,"Recent studies on event detection (ED) have shown that the syntactic dependency graph can be employed in graph convolution neural networks (GCN) to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In addition, the current models for ED fail to exploit the overall contextual importance scores of the words, which can be obtained via the dependency tree, to boost the performance. In this study, we propose a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate.

Information Extraction,Learning from Context or Names? An Empirical Study on Neural Relation Extraction,"Neural models have achieved remarkable success on relation extraction (RE) benchmarks. However, there is no clear understanding which type of information affects existing RE models to make decisions and how to further improve the performance of these models. To this end, we empirically study the effect of two main information sources in text: textual context and entity mentions (names). We find that (i) while context is the main source to support the predictions, RE models also heavily rely on the information from entity mentions, most of which is type information, and (ii) existing datasets may leak shallow heuristics via entity mentions and thus contribute to the high performance on RE benchmarks. Based on the analyses, we propose an entity-masked contrastive pre-training framework for RE to gain a deeper understanding on both textual context and type information while avoiding rote memorization of entities or use of superficial cues in mentions. We carry out extensive experiments to support our views, and show that our framework can improve the effectiveness and robustness of neural models in different RE scenarios.

Information Extraction,Knowledge Graph Alignment with Entity-Pair Embedding,"Knowledge Graph (KG) alignment is to match entities in different KGs, which is important to knowledge fusion and integration. Recently, a number of embedding-based approaches for KG alignment have been proposed and achieved promising results. These approaches first embed entities in low-dimensional vector spaces, and then obtain entity alignments by computations on their vector representations. Although continuous improvements have been achieved by recent work, the performances of existing approaches are still not satisfactory. In this work, we present a new approach that directly learns embeddings of entity-pairs for KG alignment. Our approach first generates a pair-wise connectivity graph (PCG) of two KGs, whose nodes are entitypairs and edges correspond to relation-pairs; it then learns node (entity-pair) embeddings of the PCG, which are used to predict equivalent relations of entities. To get desirable embeddings, a convolutional neural network is used to generate similarity features of entity-pairs from their attributes; and a graph neural network is employed to propagate the similarity features and get the final embeddings of entitypairs. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our approach can achieve the stateof-the-art KG alignment results.","{'sequence': 'Knowledge Graph (KG) alignment is to match entities in different KGs, which is important to knowledge fusion and integration.

Information Extraction,MedFilter: Improving Extraction of Task-relevant Utterances through Integration of Discourse Structure and Ontological Knowledge,"Information extraction from conversational data is particularly challenging because the task-centric nature of conversation allows for effective communication of implicit information by humans, but is challenging for machines. The challenges may differ between utterances depending on the role of the speaker within the conversation, especially when relevant expertise is distributed asymmetrically across roles. Further, the challenges may also increase over the conversation as more shared context is built up through information communicated implicitly earlier in the dialogue. In this paper, we propose the novel modeling approach MEDFILTER, which addresses these insights in order to increase performance at identifying and categorizing task-relevant utterances, and in so doing, positively impacts performance at a downstream information extraction task. We evaluate this approach on a corpus of nearly 7,000 doctor-patient conversations where MEDFILTER is used to identify medically relevant contributions to the discussion (achieving a 10% improvement over SOTA baselines in terms of area under the PR curve). Identifying task-relevant utterances benefits downstream medical processing, achieving improvements of 15%, 105%, and 23% respectively for the extraction of symptoms, medications, and complaints.","{'sequence': 'Information extraction from conversational data is particularly challenging because the task-centric nature of conversation allows for effective communication of implicit information by humans, but is challenging for machines.

Information Extraction,Two are Better than One: Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with Table-Sequence Encoders,"Named entity recognition and relation extraction are two important fundamental problems. Joint learning algorithms have been proposed to solve both tasks simultaneously, and many of them cast the joint task as a table-filling problem. However, they typically focused on learning a single encoder (usually learning representation in the form of a table) to capture information required for both tasks within the same space. We argue that it can be beneficial to design two distinct encoders to capture such two different types of information in the learning process. In this work, we propose the novel table-sequence encoders where two different encoders -a table encoder and a sequence encoder are designed to help each other in the representation learning process. Our experiments confirm the advantages of having two encoders over one encoder.

Information Extraction,SeqMix: Augmenting Active Sequence Labeling via Sequence Mixup,"Active learning is an important technique for low-resource sequence labeling tasks. However, current active sequence labeling methods use the queried samples alone in each iteration, which is an inefficient way of leveraging human annotations. We propose a simple but effective data augmentation method to improve label efficiency of active sequence labeling. Our method, SeqMix, simply augments the queried samples by generating extra labeled sequences in each iteration. The key difficulty is to generate plausible sequences along with token-level labels. In SeqMix, we address this challenge by performing mixup for both sequences and token-level labels of the queried samples. Furthermore, we design a discriminator during sequence mixup, which judges whether the generated sequences are plausible or not. Our experiments on Named Entity Recognition and Event Detection tasks show that SeqMix can improve the standard active sequence labeling method by 2.27%-3.75% in terms of F 1 scores.

Information Extraction,"Exploring and Evaluating Attributes, Values, and Structures for Entity Alignment","Entity alignment (EA) aims at building a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of rich content by linking the equivalent entities from various KGs. GNN-based EA methods present promising performance by modeling the KG structure defined by relation triples. However, attribute triples can also provide crucial alignment signal but have not been well explored yet. In this paper, we propose to utilize an attributed value encoder and partition the KG into subgraphs to model the various types of attribute triples efficiently. Besides, the performances of current EA methods are overestimated because of the name-bias of existing EA datasets. To make an objective evaluation, we propose a hard experimental setting where we select equivalent entity pairs with very different names as the test set. Under both the regular and hard settings, our method achieves significant improvements (5.10% on average Hits@1 in DBP15k) over 12 baselines in crosslingual and monolingual datasets. Ablation studies on different subgraphs and a case study about attribute types further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

To learn the encoders, we devise three customized pretraining objectives from different perspectives, which target on tokens, spans, and span pairs. In particular, a span encoder is trained to recover a random shuffling of tokens in a span, and a span pair encoder is trained to predict positive pairs that are from the same sentences and negative pairs that are from different sentences using contrastive loss.

In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate that using ELQ significantly improves the downstream QA performance of GraphRetriever (Min et al., 2019) . 1', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.2562607526779175, 0.09115605056285858, 0.07390882074832916, 0.07292693108320236, 0.04757177084684372, 0.04135802760720253, 0.036623310297727585, 0.03649653494358063, 0.032892659306526184, 0.03055928833782673, 0.028600534424185753, 0.02828068658709526, 0.027684804052114487, 0.025339309126138687, 0.024825183674693108, 0.02271786704659462, 0.02149234712123871, 0.02009281888604164, 0.018474074080586433, 0.018129711970686913, 0.01628314144909382, 0.014641801826655865, 0.013683588244020939]}",0.2562607526779175,Question Answering,0.07390882074832916
Information Extraction,Counterfactual Generator: A Weakly-Supervised Method for Named Entity Recognition,"Past progress on neural models has proven that named entity recognition is no longer a problem if we have enough labeled data. However, collecting enough data and annotating them are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. In this paper, we decompose the sentence into two parts: entity and context, and rethink the relationship between them and model performance from a causal perspective. Based on this, we propose the Counterfactual Generator, which generates counterfactual examples by the interventions on the existing observational examples to enhance the original dataset. Experiments across three datasets show that our method improves the generalization ability of models under limited observational examples. Besides, we provide a theoretical foundation by using a structural causal model to explore the spurious correlations between input features and output labels. We investigate the causal effects of entity or context on model performance under both conditions: the non-augmented and the augmented. Interestingly, we find that the non-spurious correlations are more located in entity representation rather than context representation. As a result, our method eliminates part of the spurious correlations between context representation and output labels. The code is available at https://github.com/xijiz/cfgen.","{'sequence': 'Past progress on neural models has proven that named entity recognition is no longer a problem if we have enough labeled data.

Information Extraction,FedED: Federated Learning via Ensemble Distillation for Medical Relation Extraction,"Unlike other domains, medical texts are inevitably accompanied by private information, so sharing or copying these texts is strictly restricted. However, training a medical relation extraction model requires collecting these privacy-sensitive texts and storing them on one machine, which comes in conflict with privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a privacypreserving medical relation extraction model based on federated learning, which enables training a central model with no single piece of private local data being shared or exchanged. Though federated learning has distinct advantages in privacy protection, it suffers from the communication bottleneck, which is mainly caused by the need to upload cumbersome local parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we leverage a strategy based on knowledge distillation. Such a strategy uses the uploaded predictions of ensemble local models to train the central model without requiring uploading local parameters.

Information Extraction,Coarse-to-Fine Pre-training for Named Entity Recognition,"More recently, Named Entity Recognition has achieved great advances aided by pre-training approaches such as BERT. However, current pre-training techniques focus on building language modeling objectives to learn a general representation, ignoring the named entityrelated knowledge. To this end, we propose a NER-specific pre-training framework to inject coarse-to-fine automatically mined entity knowledge into pre-trained models. Specifically, we first warm-up the model via an entity span identification task by training it with Wikipedia anchors, which can be deemed as general-typed entities. Then we leverage the gazetteer-based distant supervision strategy to train the model extract coarse-grained typed entities. Finally, we devise a self-supervised auxiliary task to mine the fine-grained named entity knowledge via clustering. Empirical studies on three public NER datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements against several pre-trained baselines, establishing the new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.

Information Extraction,A Rigorous Study on Named Entity Recognition: Can Fine-tuning Pretrained Model Lead to the Promised Land?,"Fine-tuning pretrained model has achieved promising performance on standard NER benchmarks. Generally, these benchmarks are blessed with strong name regularity, high mention coverage and sufficient context diversity. Unfortunately, when scaling NER to open situations, these advantages may no longer exist. And therefore it raises a critical question of whether previous creditable approaches can still work well when facing these challenges. As there is no currently available dataset to investigate this problem, this paper proposes to conduct randomization test on standard benchmarks. Specifically, we erase name regularity, mention coverage and context diversity respectively from the benchmarks, in order to explore their impact on the generalization ability of models. To further verify our conclusions, we also construct a new open NER dataset that focuses on entity types with weaker name regularity and lower mention coverage to verify our conclusion. From both randomization test and empirical experiments, we draw the conclusions that 1) name regularity is critical for the models to generalize to unseen mentions; 2) high mention coverage may undermine the model generalization ability and 3) context patterns may not require enormous data to capture when using pretrained encoders.","{'sequence': 'Fine-tuning pretrained model has achieved promising performance on standard NER benchmarks.

The best performing combination for our approach performs as well as classical topic models, but with lower runtime and computational complexity.', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Question Answering', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07638747990131378, 0.07424436509609222, 0.06879040598869324, 0.06419939547777176, 0.060484327375888824, 0.05684955418109894, 0.05296174809336662, 0.050826992839574814, 0.05050130560994148, 0.044093359261751175, 0.04387935996055603, 0.04244799166917801, 0.042185988277196884, 0.038759730756282806, 0.03668377175927162, 0.0328487902879715, 0.031140170991420746, 0.0306885726749897, 0.028906695544719696, 0.02343577891588211, 0.0210175309330225, 0.018822209909558296, 0.009844492189586163]}",0.07638747990131378,Speech and Multimodality,0.042185988277196884
Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Evaluating the Calibration of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Trustworthy Link Prediction,"Little is known about the trustworthiness of predictions made by knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. In this paper we take initial steps toward this direction by investigating the calibration of KGE models, or the extent to which they output confidence scores that reflect the expected correctness of predicted knowledge graph triples. We first conduct an evaluation under the standard closed-world assumption (CWA), in which predicted triples not already in the knowledge graph are considered false, and show that existing calibration techniques are effective for KGE under this common but narrow assumption. Next, we introduce the more realistic but challenging open-world assumption (OWA), in which unobserved predictions are not considered true or false until ground-truth labels are obtained. Here, we show that existing calibration techniques are much less effective under the OWA than the CWA, and provide explanations for this discrepancy. Finally, to motivate the utility of calibration for KGE from a practitioner's perspective, we conduct a unique case study of human-AI collaboration, showing that calibrated predictions can improve human performance in a knowledge graph completion task. * This work was done during an internship at Bloomberg.","{'sequence': ""Little is known about the trustworthiness of predictions made by knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Multi-document Summarization with Maximal Marginal Relevance-guided Reinforcement Learning,"While neural sequence learning methods have made significant progress in single-document summarization (SDS), they produce unsatisfactory results on multi-document summarization (MDS). We observe two major challenges when adapting SDS advances to MDS: (1) MDS involves larger search space and yet more limited training data, setting obstacles for neural methods to learn adequate representations; (2) MDS needs to resolve higher information redundancy among the source documents, which SDS methods are less effective to handle. To close the gap, we present RL-MMR, Maximal Margin Relevance-guided Reinforcement Learning for MDS, which unifies advanced neural SDS methods and statistical measures used in classical MDS. RL-MMR casts MMR guidance on fewer promising candidates, which restrains the search space and thus leads to better representation learning. Additionally, the explicit redundancy measure in MMR helps the neural representation of the summary to better capture redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark MDS datasets. In particular, we show the benefits of incorporating MMR into end-to-end learning when adapting SDS to MDS in terms of both learning effectiveness and efficiency. 1","{'sequence': 'While neural sequence learning methods have made significant progress in single-document summarization (SDS), they produce unsatisfactory results on multi-document summarization (MDS).

Through benchmark experiments on 20 EL baselines from string-to neural-based models we shed light on the ability of these systems to perform complex inference on entities and concepts under 2 challenging evaluation scenarios. Our experimental results on COMETA illustrate that no golden bullet exists and even the best mainstream techniques still have a significant performance gap to fill, while the best solution relies on combining different views of data."", 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Summarization', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09580304473638535, 0.0613669790327549, 0.061178866773843765, 0.05939672142267227, 0.05905855447053909, 0.057385385036468506, 0.05678708851337433, 0.05355815216898918, 0.049330998212099075, 0.04860847815871239, 0.04816566780209541, 0.047136712819337845, 0.043843649327754974, 0.04295562580227852, 0.03451091796159744, 0.028614867478609085, 0.027760637924075127, 0.02591177634894848, 0.025158274918794632, 0.024567563086748123, 0.017540888860821724, 0.017070943489670753, 0.014288217760622501]}",0.09580304473638535,Resources and Evaluation,0.04295562580227852
Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Short Text Topic Modeling with Topic Distribution Quantization and Negative Sampling Decoder,"Topic models have been prevailing for many years on discovering latent semantics while modeling long documents. However, for short texts they generally suffer from data sparsity because of extremely limited word cooccurrences; thus tend to yield repetitive or trivial topics with low quality. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a novel neural topic model in the framework of autoencoding with a new topic distribution quantization approach generating peakier distributions that are more appropriate for modeling short texts. Besides the encoding, to tackle this issue in terms of decoding, we further propose a novel negative sampling decoder learning from negative samples to avoid yielding repetitive topics. We observe that our model can highly improve short text topic modeling performance. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate our model can outperform both strong traditional and neural baselines under extreme data sparsity scenes, producing high-quality topics.","{'sequence': 'Topic models have been prevailing for many years on discovering latent semantics while modeling long documents.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Exploiting Structured Knowledge in Text via Graph-Guided Representation Learning,"In this work, we aim at equipping pre-trained language models with structured knowledge. We present two self-supervised tasks learning over raw text with the guidance from knowledge graphs. Building upon entity-level masked language models, our first contribution is an entity masking scheme that exploits relational knowledge underlying the text. This is fulfilled by using a linked knowledge graph to select informative entities and then masking their mentions. In addition, we use knowledge graphs to obtain distractors for the masked entities, and propose a novel distractor-suppressed ranking objective that is optimized jointly with masked language model. In contrast to existing paradigms, our approach uses knowledge graphs implicitly, only during pre-training, to inject language models with structured knowledge via learning from raw text. It is more efficient than retrieval-based methods that perform entity linking and integration during finetuning and inference, and generalizes more effectively than the methods that directly learn from concatenated graph triples. Experiments show that our proposed model achieves improved performance on five benchmarks, including question answering and knowledge base completion.","{'sequence': 'In this work, we aim at equipping pre-trained language models with structured knowledge.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,SynSetExpan: An Iterative Framework for Joint Entity Set Expansion and Synonym Discovery,"Entity set expansion and synonym discovery are two critical NLP tasks. Previous studies accomplish them separately, without exploring their interdependences. In this work, we hypothesize that these two tasks are tightly coupled because two synonymous entities tend to have similar likelihoods of belonging to various semantic classes. This motivates us to design SynSetExpan, a novel framework that enables two tasks to mutually enhance each other. SynSetExpan uses a synonym discovery model to include popular entities' infrequent synonyms into the set, which boosts the set expansion recall. Meanwhile, the set expansion model, being able to determine whether an entity belongs to a semantic class, can generate pseudo training data to fine-tune the synonym discovery model towards better accuracy. To facilitate the research on studying the interplays of these two tasks, we create the first large-scale Synonym-Enhanced Set Expansion (SE2) dataset via crowdsourcing. Extensive experiments on the SE2 dataset and previous benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SynSetExpan for both entity set expansion and synonym discovery tasks.","{'sequence': ""Entity set expansion and synonym discovery are two critical NLP tasks.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Towards More Accurate Uncertainty Estimation In Text Classification,"The uncertainty measurement of classified results is especially important in areas requiring limited human resources for higher accuracy. For instance, data-driven algorithms diagnosing diseases need accurate uncertainty score to decide whether additional but limited quantity of experts are needed for rectification. However, few uncertainty models focus on improving the performance of text classification where human resources are involved. To achieve this, we aim at generating accurate uncertainty score by improving the confidence of winning scores. Thus, a model called MSD, which includes three independent components as ""mix-up"", ""self-ensembling"", ""distinctiveness score"", is proposed to improve the accuracy of uncertainty score by reducing the effect of overconfidence of winning score and considering the impact of different categories of uncertainty simultaneously. MSD can be applied with different Deep Neural Networks. Extensive experiments with ablation setting are conducted on four real-world datasets, on which, competitive results are obtained.","{'sequence': 'The uncertainty measurement of classified results is especially important in areas requiring limited human resources for higher accuracy.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Conditional Causal Relationships between Emotions and Causes in Texts,"The causal relationships between emotions and causes in text have recently received a lot of attention. Most of the existing works focus on the extraction of the causally related clauses from documents. However, none of these works has considered the possibility that the causal relationships among the extracted emotion and cause clauses may only be valid under a specific context, without which the extracted clauses may not be causally related. To address such an issue, we propose a new task of determining whether or not an input pair of emotion and cause has a valid causal relationship under different contexts, and construct a corresponding dataset via manual annotation and negative sampling based on an existing benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we propose a prediction aggregation module with low computational overhead to fine-tune the prediction results based on the characteristics of the input clauses. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our aggregation module.","{'sequence': 'The causal relationships between emotions and causes in text have recently received a lot of attention.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Neural Topic Modeling with Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Training,"Advances on deep generative models have attracted significant research interest in neural topic modeling. The recently proposed Adversarial-neural Topic Model models topics with an adversarially trained generator network and employs Dirichlet prior to capture the semantic patterns in latent topics. It is effective in discovering coherent topics but unable to infer topic distributions for given documents or utilize available document labels. To overcome such limitations, we propose Topic Modeling with Cycle-consistent Adversarial Training (ToMCAT) and its supervised version sToMCAT. ToMCAT employs a generator network to interpret topics and an encoder network to infer document topics. Adversarial training and cycle-consistent constraints are used to encourage the generator and the encoder to produce realistic samples that coordinate with each other. sToMCAT extends ToM-CAT by incorporating document labels into the topic modeling process to help discover more coherent topics. The effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on unsupervised/supervised topic modeling and text classification. The experimental results show that our models can produce both coherent and informative topics, outperforming a number of competitive baselines.","{'sequence': 'Advances on deep generative models have attracted significant research interest in neural topic modeling.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Named Entity Recognition Only from Word Embeddings,"Deep neural network models have helped named entity recognition achieve amazing performance without handcrafting features. However, existing systems require large amounts of human annotated training data. Efforts have been made to replace human annotations with external knowledge (e.g., NE dictionary, partof-speech tags), while it is another challenge to obtain such effective resources. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised NE recognition model which only needs to take informative clues from pre-trained word embeddings. We first apply Gaussian Hidden Markov Model and Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model on word embeddings for entity span detection and type prediction, and then further design an instance selector based on reinforcement learning to distinguish positive sentences from noisy sentences and then refine these coarse-grained annotations through neural networks. Extensive experiments on two CoNLL benchmark NER datasets (CoNLL-2003 English dataset and CoNLL-2002 Spanish dataset) demonstrate that our proposed light NE recognition model achieves remarkable performance without using any annotated lexicon or corpus.","{'sequence': 'Deep neural network models have helped named entity recognition achieve amazing performance without handcrafting features.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Meta Fine-Tuning Neural Language Models for Multi-Domain Text Mining,"Pre-trained neural language models bring significant improvement for various NLP tasks, by fine-tuning the models on task-specific training sets. During fine-tuning, the parameters are initialized from pre-trained models directly, which ignores how the learning process of similar NLP tasks in different domains is correlated and mutually reinforced. In this paper, we propose an effective learning procedure named Meta Fine-Tuning (MFT), serving as a meta-learner to solve a group of similar NLP tasks for neural language models. Instead of simply multi-task training over all the datasets, MFT only learns from typical instances of various domains to acquire highly transferable knowledge. It further encourages the language model to encode domaininvariant representations by optimizing a series of novel domain corruption loss functions. After MFT, the model can be fine-tuned for each domain with better parameter initialization and higher generalization ability.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,A matter of framing: The impact of linguistic formalism on probing results,"Deep pre-trained contextualized encoders like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)  demonstrate remarkable performance on a range of downstream tasks. A recent line of research in probing investigates the linguistic knowledge implicitly learned by these models during pretraining. While most work in probing operates on the task level, linguistic tasks are rarely uniform and can be represented in a variety of formalisms. Any linguistics-based probing study thereby inevitably commits to the formalism used to annotate the underlying data. Can the choice of formalism affect probing results? To investigate, we conduct an in-depth cross-formalism layer probing study in role semantics. We find linguistically meaningful differences in the encoding of semantic role-and proto-role information by BERT depending on the formalism and demonstrate that layer probing can detect subtle differences between the implementations of the same linguistic formalism. Our results suggest that linguistic formalism is an important dimension in probing studies and should be investigated along with the commonly used cross-task and cross-lingual experimental settings.","{'sequence': 'Deep pre-trained contextualized encoders like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)  demonstrate remarkable performance on a range of downstream tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Learning Music Helps You Read: Using Transfer to Study Linguistic Structure in Language Models,"We propose transfer learning as a method for analyzing the encoding of grammatical structure in neural language models. We train LSTMs on non-linguistic data and evaluate their performance on natural language to assess which kinds of data induce generalizable structural features that LSTMs can use for natural language. We find that training on nonlinguistic data with latent structure (MIDI music or Java code) improves test performance on natural language, despite no overlap in surface form or vocabulary. To pinpoint the kinds of abstract structure that models may be encoding to lead to this improvement, we run similar experiments with two artificial parentheses languages: one which has a hierarchical recursive structure, and a control which has paired tokens but no recursion. Surprisingly, training a model on either of these artificial languages leads the same substantial gains when testing on natural language. Further experiments on transfer between natural languages controlling for vocabulary overlap show that zero-shot performance on a test language is highly correlated with typological syntactic similarity to the training language, suggesting that representations induced by pre-training correspond to the cross-linguistic syntactic properties. Our results provide insights into the ways that neural models represent abstract syntactic structure, and also about the kind of structural inductive biases which allow for natural language acquisition. 1","{'sequence': 'We propose transfer learning as a method for analyzing the encoding of grammatical structure in neural language models.

Our results provide insights into the ways that neural models represent abstract syntactic structure, and also about the kind of structural inductive biases which allow for natural language acquisition. 1', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08708703517913818, 0.07393378019332886, 0.05755368620157242, 0.055717699229717255, 0.055624719709157944, 0.05349995568394661, 0.04864586889743805, 0.048620764166116714, 0.04400934278964996, 0.043533455580472946, 0.04306637495756149, 0.041915543377399445, 0.040487874299287796, 0.0404408797621727, 0.039312783628702164, 0.03742733225226402, 0.03610384836792946, 0.03159736469388008, 0.030877292156219482, 0.02963886223733425, 0.02605796419084072, 0.020373480394482613, 0.01447402872145176]}",0.08708703517913818,Question Answering,0.05755368620157242
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Improving Low Compute Language Modeling with In-Domain Embedding Initialisation,"Many NLP applications, such as biomedical data and technical support, have 10-100 million tokens of in-domain data and limited computational resources for learning from it. How should we train a language model in this scenario? Most language modeling research considers either a small dataset with a closed vocabulary (like the standard 1 million token Penn Treebank), or the whole web with bytepair encoding. We show that for our target setting in English, initialising and freezing input embeddings using in-domain data can improve language model performance by providing a useful representation of rare words, and this pattern holds across several different domains. In the process, we show that the standard convention of tying input and output embeddings does not improve perplexity when initializing with embeddings trained on in-domain data.","{'sequence': 'Many NLP applications, such as biomedical data and technical support, have 10-100 million tokens of in-domain data and limited computational resources for learning from it.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Hate-Speech and Offensive Language Detection in Roman Urdu,"The task of automatic hate-speech and offensive language detection in social media content is of utmost importance due to its implications in unprejudiced society concerning race, gender, or religion.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An information theoretic view on selecting linguistic probes,"There is increasing interest in assessing the linguistic knowledge encoded in neural representations. A popular approach is to attach a diagnostic classifier -or ""probe"" -to perform supervised classification from internal representations. However, how to select a good probe is in debate. Hewitt and Liang (2019) showed that a high performance on diagnostic classification itself is insufficient, because it can be attributed to either ""the representation being rich in knowledge"", or ""the probe learning the task"", which Pimentel et al. ( 2020 ) challenged. We show this dichotomy is valid informationtheoretically. In addition, we find that the methods to construct and select good probes proposed by the two papers, control task (Hewitt and Liang, 2019) and control function (Pimentel et al., 2020), are equivalent -the errors of their approaches are identical (modulo irrelevant terms). Empirically, these two selection criteria lead to results that highly agree with each other.","{'sequence': 'There is increasing interest in assessing the linguistic knowledge encoded in neural representations.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Dataset Cartography: Mapping and Diagnosing Datasets with Training Dynamics,"Large datasets have become commonplace in NLP research. However, the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging to assess the quality of data. We introduce Data Maps-a model-based tool to characterize and diagnose datasets. We leverage a largely ignored source of information: the behavior of the model on individual instances during training (training dynamics) for building data maps. This yields two intuitive measures for each example-the model's confidence in the true class, and the variability of this confidence across epochs-obtained in a single run of training. Experiments across four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced characteristics. First, our data maps show the presence of ambiguous regions with respect to the model, which contribute the most towards out-of-distribution generalization. Second, the most populous regions in the data are easy to learn for the model, and play an important role in model optimization. Finally, data maps uncover a region with instances that the model finds hard to learn; these often correspond to labeling errors.

Our empirical results show that this machine-augmented human attention supervision is more effective than existing methods requiring a higher annotation cost, in text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and news categorization.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation'], 'scores': [0.1217094212770462, 0.07017938792705536, 0.06808140873908997, 0.0629667192697525, 0.05787239596247673, 0.05069859325885773, 0.05011962354183197, 0.04960103705525398, 0.04688090831041336, 0.04677830636501312, 0.04474843293428421, 0.03912218660116196, 0.03753601759672165, 0.03184499591588974, 0.030723005533218384, 0.030711350962519646, 0.030048996210098267, 0.029616065323352814, 0.029194459319114685, 0.022746985778212547, 0.018596630543470383, 0.017096955329179764, 0.013126217760145664]}",0.1217094212770462,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.030048996210098267
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Information-Theoretic Probing with Minimum Description Length,"To measure how well pretrained representations encode some linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe, i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property from the representations. Despite widespread adoption of probes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect differences in representations. For example, they do not substantially favour pretrained representations over randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can be similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in accuracy with respect to these random baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount of probe training data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to the standard probes, information-theoretic probing with minimum description length (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict labels is recast as teaching it to effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of interest changes from probe accuracy to the description length of labels given representations. In addition to probe quality, the description length evaluates 'the amount of effort' needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines: variational coding and online coding. We show that these methods agree in results and are more informative and stable than the standard probes. 1","{'sequence': ""To measure how well pretrained representations encode some linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe, i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property from the representations.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Avoiding the Hypothesis-Only Bias in Natural Language Inference via Ensemble Adversarial Training,"Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets contain annotation artefacts resulting in spurious correlations between the natural language utterances and their respective entailment classes. These artefacts are exploited by neural networks even when only considering the hypothesis and ignoring the premise, leading to unwanted biases. Belinkov et al.

We show that the bias can be reduced in the sentence representations by using an ensemble of adversaries, encouraging the model to jointly decrease the accuracy of these different adversaries while fitting the data. This approach produces more robust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised to 12 other NLI datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020) .

We evaluate this on Transformer and BERT models on multiple NLP tasks. Firstly, we find that a large fraction of the attention heads can be randomly pruned with limited effect on accuracy. Secondly, for Transformers, we find no advantage in pruning attention heads identified to be important based on existing studies that relate importance to the location of a head. On the BERT model too we find no preference for top or bottom layers, though the latter are reported to have higher importance.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Analyzing Individual Neurons in Pre-trained Language Models,"While a lot of analysis has been carried to demonstrate linguistic knowledge captured by the representations learned within deep NLP models, very little attention has been paid towards individual neurons. We carry out a neuron-level analysis using core linguistic tasks of predicting morphology, syntax and semantics, on pre-trained language models, with questions like: i) do individual neurons in pretrained models capture linguistic information? ii) which parts of the network learn more about certain linguistic phenomena? iii) how distributed or focused is the information? and iv) how do various architectures differ in learning these properties? We found small subsets of neurons to predict linguistic tasks, with lower level tasks (such as morphology) localized in fewer neurons, compared to higher level task of predicting syntax.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,CrowS-Pairs: A Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Masked Language Models,"Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes and may be upsetting. Pretrained language models, especially masked language models (MLMs) have seen success across many NLP tasks. However, there is ample evidence that they use the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they are trained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure some forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic groups in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark (CrowS-Pairs). CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model is presented with two sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that is less stereotyping. The data focuses on stereotypes about historically disadvantaged groups and contrasts them with advantaged groups. We find that all three of the widelyused MLMs we evaluate substantially favor sentences that express stereotypes in every category in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building less biased models advances, this dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress.","{'sequence': 'Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes and may be upsetting.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,On the Ability and Limitations of Transformers to Recognize Formal Languages,"Transformers have supplanted recurrent models in a large number of NLP tasks. However, the differences in their abilities to model different syntactic properties remain largely unknown. Past works suggest that LSTMs generalize very well on regular languages and have close connections with counter languages. In this work, we systematically study the ability of Transformers to model such languages as well as the role of its individual components in doing so. We first provide a construction of Transformers for a subclass of counter languages, including well-studied languages such as n-ary Boolean Expressions, Dyck-1, and its generalizations. In experiments, we find that Transformers do well on this subclass, and their learned mechanism strongly correlates with our construction. Perhaps surprisingly, in contrast to LSTMs, Transformers do well only on a subset of regular languages with degrading performance as we make languages more complex according to a well-known measure of complexity. Our analysis also provides insights on the role of self-attention mechanism in modeling certain behaviors and the influence of positional encoding schemes on the learning and generalization abilities of the model.","{'sequence': 'Transformers have supplanted recurrent models in a large number of NLP tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Cold-Start and Interpretability: Turning Regular Expressions into Trainable Recurrent Neural Networks,"Neural networks can achieve impressive performance on many natural language processing applications, but they typically need large labeled data for training and are not easily interpretable. On the other hand, symbolic rules such as regular expressions are interpretable, require no training, and often achieve decent accuracy; but rules cannot benefit from labeled data when available and hence underperform neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose a type of recurrent neural networks called FA-RNNs that combine the advantages of neural networks and regular expression rules. An FA-RNN can be converted from regular expressions and deployed in zero-shot and cold-start scenarios. It can also utilize labeled data for training to achieve improved prediction accuracy. After training, an FA-RNN often remains interpretable and can be converted back into regular expressions. We apply FA-RNNs to text classification and observe that FA-RNNs significantly outperform previous neural approaches in both zeroshot and low-resource settings and remain very competitive in rich-resource settings.","{'sequence': 'Neural networks can achieve impressive performance on many natural language processing applications, but they typically need large labeled data for training and are not easily interpretable.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Dissecting Span Identification Tasks with Performance Prediction,"Span identification (in short, span ID) tasks such as chunking, NER, or code-switching detection, ask models to identify and classify relevant spans in a text. Despite being a staple of NLP, and sharing a common structure, there is little insight on how these tasks' properties influence their difficulty, and thus little guidance on what model families work well on span ID tasks, and why. We analyze span ID tasks via performance prediction, estimating how well neural architectures do on different tasks. Our contributions are: (a) we identify key properties of span ID tasks that can inform performance prediction; (b) we carry out a large-scale experiment on English data, building a model to predict performance for unseen span ID tasks that can support architecture choices; (c), we investigate the parameters of the meta model, yielding new insights on how model and task properties interact to affect span ID performance. We find, e.g., that span frequency is especially important for LSTMs, and that CRFs help when spans are infrequent and boundaries non-distinctive.","{'sequence': ""Span identification (in short, span ID) tasks such as chunking, NER, or code-switching detection, ask models to identify and classify relevant spans in a text.

Our contributions are: (a) we identify key properties of span ID tasks that can inform performance prediction; (b) we carry out a large-scale experiment on English data, building a model to predict performance for unseen span ID tasks that can support architecture choices; (c), we investigate the parameters of the meta model, yielding new insights on how model and task properties interact to affect span ID performance. We find, e.g., that span frequency is especially important for LSTMs, and that CRFs help when spans are infrequent and boundaries non-distinctive."", 'labels': ['Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation'], 'scores': [0.09767414629459381, 0.09732048213481903, 0.08295981585979462, 0.06547515094280243, 0.06215635687112808, 0.056276287883520126, 0.049623992294073105, 0.04832704737782478, 0.04682815074920654, 0.0422833226621151, 0.03907433897256851, 0.03717825934290886, 0.035267479717731476, 0.033045023679733276, 0.031264759600162506, 0.0295939389616251, 0.026980238035321236, 0.02520793117582798, 0.022322313860058784, 0.022133084014058113, 0.019393308088183403, 0.015470555983483791, 0.01414393074810505]}",0.09767414629459381,Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,0.09767414629459381

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Towards Interpreting BERT for Reading Comprehension Based QA,"BERT and its variants have achieved stateof-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. Since then, various works have been proposed to analyze the linguistic information being captured in BERT. However, the current works do not provide an insight into how BERT is able to achieve near human-level performance on the task of Reading Comprehension based Question Answering. In this work, we attempt to interpret BERT for RCQA. Since BERT layers do not have predefined roles, we define a layer's role or functionality using Integrated Gradients. Based on the defined roles, we perform a preliminary analysis across all layers. We observed that the initial layers focus on query-passage interaction, whereas later layers focus more on contextual understanding and enhancing the answer prediction. Specifically for quantifier questions (how much/how many), we notice that BERT focuses on confusing words (i.e., on other numerical quantities in the passage) in the later layers, but still manages to predict the answer correctly.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Birds have four legs?! NumerSense: Probing Numerical Commonsense Knowledge of Pre-Trained Language Models,"Recent works show that pre-trained language models (PTLMs), such as BERT, possess certain commonsense and factual knowledge. They suggest that it is promising to use PTLMs as ""neural knowledge bases"" via predicting masked words. Surprisingly, we find that this may not work for numerical commonsense knowledge (e.g., a bird usually has two legs). In this paper, we investigate whether and to what extent we can induce numerical commonsense knowledge from PTLMs as well as the robustness of this process. To study this, we introduce a novel probing task with a diagnostic dataset, NUMERSENSE 1 , containing 13.6k masked-word-prediction probes (10.5k for fine-tuning and 3.1k for testing). Our analysis reveals that: (1) BERT and its stronger variant RoBERTa perform poorly on the diagnostic dataset prior to any fine-tuning; (2) finetuning with distant supervision brings some improvement; (3) the best supervised model still performs poorly as compared to human performance (54.06% vs. 96.3% in accuracy).","{'sequence': 'Recent works show that pre-trained language models (PTLMs), such as BERT, possess certain commonsense and factual knowledge.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,With Little Power Comes Great Responsibility,"Despite its importance to experimental design, statistical power (the probability that, given a real effect, an experiment will reject the null hypothesis) has largely been ignored by the NLP community. Underpowered experiments make it more difficult to discern the difference between statistical noise and meaningful model improvements, and increase the chances of exaggerated findings. By metaanalyzing a set of existing NLP papers and datasets, we characterize typical power for a variety of settings and conclude that underpowered experiments are common in the NLP literature. In particular, for several tasks in the popular GLUE benchmark, small test sets mean that most attempted comparisons to state of the art models will not be adequately powered. Similarly, based on reasonable assumptions, we find that the most typical experimental design for human rating studies will be underpowered to detect small model differences, of the sort that are frequently studied. For machine translation, we find that typical test sets of 2000 sentences have approximately 75% power to detect differences of 1 BLEU point.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An Information Bottleneck Approach for Controlling Conciseness in Rationale Extraction,"Decisions of complex models for language understanding can be explained by limiting the inputs they are provided to a relevant subsequence of the original text -a rationale. Models that condition predictions on a concise rationale, while being more interpretable, tend to be less accurate than models that are able to use the entire context. In this paper, we show that it is possible to better manage the trade-off between concise explanations and high task accuracy by optimizing a bound on the Information Bottleneck (IB) objective. Our approach jointly learns an explainer that predicts sparse binary masks over input sentences without explicit supervision, and an end-task predictor that considers only the residual sentences. Using IB, we derive a learning objective that allows direct control of mask sparsity levels through a tunable sparse prior. Experiments on the ERASER benchmark demonstrate significant gains over previous work for both task performance and agreement with human rationales. Furthermore, we find that in the semi-supervised setting, a modest amount of gold rationales (25% of training examples with gold masks) can close the performance gap with a model that uses the full input. 1","{'sequence': 'Decisions of complex models for language understanding can be explained by limiting the inputs they are provided to a relevant subsequence of the original text -a rationale.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Generating Label Cohesive and Well-Formed Adversarial Claims,"Adversarial attacks reveal important vulnerabilities and flaws of trained models. One potent type of attack are universal adversarial triggers, which are individual n-grams that, when appended to instances of a class under attack, can trick a model into predicting a target class.

In addition, such attacks produce semantically nonsensical inputs, as they simply concatenate triggers to existing samples. Here, we investigate how to generate adversarial attacks against fact checking systems that preserve the ground truth meaning and are semantically valid. We extend the HotFlip attack algorithm used for universal trigger generation by jointly minimizing the target class loss of a fact checking model and the entailment class loss of an auxiliary natural language inference model. We then train a conditional language model to generate semantically valid statements, which include the found universal triggers.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Pareto Probing: Trading Off Accuracy for Complexity,"The question of how to probe contextual word representations for linguistic structure in a way that is both principled and useful has seen significant attention recently in the NLP literature. In our contribution to this discussion, we argue for a probe metric that reflects the fundamental trade-off between probe complexity and performance: the Pareto hypervolume. To measure complexity, we present a number of parametric and non-parametric metrics. Our experiments using Pareto hypervolume as an evaluation metric show that probes often do not conform to our expectations-e.g., why should the non-contextual fastText representations encode more morpho-syntactic information than the contextual BERT representations? These results suggest that common, simplistic probing tasks, such as part-of-speech labeling and dependency arc labeling, are inadequate to evaluate the linguistic structure encoded in contextual word representations. This leads us to propose full dependency parsing as a probing task. In support of our suggestion that harder probing tasks are necessary, our experiments with dependency parsing reveal a wide gap in syntactic knowledge between contextual and non-contextual representations.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,To BERT or Not to BERT: Comparing Task-specific and Task-agnostic Semi-Supervised Approaches for Sequence Tagging,"Leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data using Transformer-like architectures, like BERT, has gained popularity in recent times owing to their effectiveness in learning general representations that can then be further fine-tuned for downstream tasks to much success.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,How do Decisions Emerge across Layers in Neural Models? Interpretation with Differentiable Masking,"Attribution methods assess the contribution of inputs to the model prediction. One way to do so is erasure: a subset of inputs is considered irrelevant if it can be removed without affecting the prediction. Though conceptually simple, erasure's objective is intractable and approximate search remains expensive with modern deep NLP models. Erasure is also susceptible to the hindsight bias: the fact that an input can be dropped does not mean that the model 'knows' it can be dropped. The resulting pruning is over-aggressive and does not reflect how the model arrives at the prediction. To deal with these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Masking. DIFFMASK learns to maskout subsets of the input while maintaining differentiability. The decision to include or disregard an input token is made with a simple model based on intermediate hidden layers of the analyzed model. First, this makes the approach efficient because we predict rather than search. Second, as with probing classifiers, this reveals what the network 'knows' at the corresponding layers.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Assessing Phrasal Representation and Composition in Transformers,"Deep transformer models have pushed performance on NLP tasks to new limits, suggesting sophisticated treatment of complex linguistic inputs, such as phrases. However, we have limited understanding of how these models handle representation of phrases, and whether this reflects sophisticated composition of phrase meaning like that done by humans. In this paper, we present systematic analysis of phrasal representations in state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,AutoPrompt: Eliciting Knowledge from Language Models with Automatically Generated Prompts,"The remarkable success of pretrained language models has motivated the study of what kinds of knowledge these models learn during pretraining. Reformulating tasks as fillin-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge, however, its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. To address this, we develop AUTOPROMPT, an automated method to create prompts for a diverse set of tasks, based on a gradient-guided search. Using AUTO-PROMPT, we show that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning, sometimes achieving performance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark, and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that automatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods, and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable, potentially a replacement for finetuning.","{'sequence': 'The remarkable success of pretrained language models has motivated the study of what kinds of knowledge these models learn during pretraining.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An Empirical Investigation Towards Efficient Multi-Domain Language Model Pre-training,"Pre-training large language models has become a standard in the natural language processing community. Such models are pretrained on generic data (e.g. BookCorpus and English Wikipedia) and often fine-tuned on tasks in the same domain. However, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance on out of domain tasks such as clinical named entity recognition and relation extraction, additional in domain pre-training is required. In practice, staged multi-domain pre-training presents performance deterioration in the form of catastrophic forgetting (CF) when evaluated on a generic benchmark such as GLUE. In this paper we conduct an empirical investigation into known methods to mitigate CF. We find that elastic weight consolidation provides best overall scores yielding only a 0.33% drop in performance across seven generic tasks while remaining competitive in bio-medical tasks. Furthermore, we explore gradient and latent clustering based data selection techniques to improve coverage when using elastic weight consolidation and experience replay methods.","{'sequence': 'Pre-training large language models has become a standard in the natural language processing community.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,A Diagnostic Study of Explainability Techniques for Text Classification,"Recent developments in machine learning have introduced models that approach human performance at the cost of increased architectural complexity. Efforts to make the rationales behind the models' predictions transparent have inspired an abundance of new explainability techniques.

However, there exists no definitive guide on (i) how to choose such a technique given a particular application task and model architecture, and (ii) the benefits and drawbacks of using each such technique. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive list of diagnostic properties for evaluating existing explainability techniques. We then employ the proposed list to compare a set of diverse explainability techniques on downstream text classification tasks and neural network architectures. We also compare the saliency scores assigned by the explainability techniques with human annotations of salient input regions to find relations between a model's performance and the agreement of its rationales with human ones.

Generation,Reading Between the Lines: Exploring Infilling in Visual Narratives,"Generating long form narratives such as stories and procedures from multiple modalities has been a long standing dream for artificial intelligence. In this regard, there is often crucial subtext that is derived from the surrounding contexts.

Generation,Gradient-guided Unsupervised Lexically Constrained Text Generation,"Lexically-constrained generation requires the target sentence to satisfy some lexical constraints, such as containing some specific words or being the paraphrase to a given sentence, which is very important in many real-world natural language generation applications. Previous works usually apply beamsearch-based methods or stochastic searching methods to lexically-constrained generation. However, when the search space is too large, beam-search-based methods always fail to find the constrained optimal solution. At the same time, stochastic search methods always cost too many steps to find the correct optimization direction. In this paper, we propose a novel method G2LC to solve the lexically-constrained generation as an unsupervised gradient-guided optimization problem. We propose a differentiable objective function and use the gradient to help determine which position in the sequence should be changed (deleted or inserted/replaced by another word). The word updating process of the inserted/replaced word also benefits from the guidance of gradient. Besides, our method is free of parallel data training, which is flexible to be used in the inference stage of any pre-trained generation model.

Generation,Unsupervised Text Style Transfer with Padded Masked Language Models,"We propose MASKER, an unsupervised textediting method for style transfer. To tackle cases when no parallel source-target pairs are available, we train masked language models (MLMs) for both the source and the target domain. Then we find the text spans where the two models disagree the most in terms of likelihood. This allows us to identify the source tokens to delete to transform the source text to match the style of the target domain. The deleted tokens are replaced with the target MLM, and by using a padded MLM variant, we avoid having to predetermine the number of inserted tokens.

To tackle cases when no parallel source-target pairs are available, we train masked language models (MLMs) for both the source and the target domain. Then we find the text spans where the two models disagree the most in terms of likelihood. This allows us to identify the source tokens to delete to transform the source text to match the style of the target domain. The deleted tokens are replaced with the target MLM, and by using a padded MLM variant, we avoid having to predetermine the number of inserted tokens.

Generation,Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase Generation,"Modern NLP defines the task of style transfer as modifying the style of a given sentence without appreciably changing its semantics, which implies that the outputs of style transfer systems should be paraphrases of their inputs. However, many existing systems purportedly designed for style transfer inherently warp the input's meaning through attribute transfer, which changes semantic properties such as sentiment. In this paper, we reformulate unsupervised style transfer as a paraphrase generation problem, and present a simple methodology based on fine-tuning pretrained language models on automatically generated paraphrase data. Despite its simplicity, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art style transfer systems on both human and automatic evaluations. We also survey 23 style transfer papers and discover that existing automatic metrics can be easily gamed and propose fixed variants. Finally, we pivot to a more real-world style transfer setting by collecting a large dataset of 15M sentences in 11 diverse styles, which we use for an in-depth analysis of our system.","{'sequence': ""Modern NLP defines the task of style transfer as modifying the style of a given sentence without appreciably changing its semantics, which implies that the outputs of style transfer systems should be paraphrases of their inputs.

In this paper, we propose a novel Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation (AC-NLG) method, consisting of an attentional encoder and a pair of innovative counterfactual decoders. The attentional encoder leverages the plaintiff's claim and fact description as input to learn a claim-aware encoder from which the claim-related information in fact description can be emphasized. The counterfactual decoders are employed to eliminate the confounding bias in data and generate judgmentdiscriminative court's views (both supportive and non-supportive views) by incorporating with a synergistic judgment predictive model. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method under both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.","{'sequence': ""Court's view generation is a novel but essential task for legal AI, aiming at improving the interpretability of judgment prediction results and enabling automatic legal document generation.

Generation,Do sequence-to-sequence VAEs learn global features of sentences?,"Autoregressive language models are powerful and relatively easy to train. However, these models are usually trained without explicit conditioning labels and do not offer easy ways to control global aspects such as sentiment or topic during generation. Bowman et al. (2016) adapted the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for natural language with the sequenceto-sequence architecture and claimed that the latent vector was able to capture such global features in an unsupervised manner. We question this claim. We measure which words benefit most from the latent information by decomposing the reconstruction loss per position in the sentence. Using this method, we find that VAEs are prone to memorizing the first words and the sentence length, producing local features of limited usefulness. To alleviate this, we investigate alternative architectures based on bag-of-words assumptions and language model pretraining. These variants learn latent variables that are more global, i.e., more predictive of topic or sentiment labels. Moreover, using reconstructions, we observe that they decrease memorization: the first word and the sentence length are not recovered as accurately than with the baselines, consequently yielding more diverse reconstructions.","{'sequence': 'Autoregressive language models are powerful and relatively easy to train.

Generation,POINTER: Constrained Progressive Text Generation via Insertion-based Generative Pre-training,"Large-scale pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT-2, have achieved excellent performance in language representation learning and free-form text generation. However, these models cannot be directly employed to generate text under specified lexical constraints. To address this challenge, we present POINTER 1 , a simple yet novel insertion-based approach for hard-constrained text generation. The proposed method operates by progressively inserting new tokens between existing tokens in a parallel manner. This procedure is recursively applied until a sequence is completed. The resulting coarse-to-fine hierarchy makes the generation process intuitive and interpretable. We pre-train our model with the proposed progressive insertion-based objective on a 12GB Wikipedia dataset, and finetune it on downstream hard-constrained generation tasks. Non-autoregressive decoding yields an empirically logarithmic time complexity during inference time. Experimental results on both News and Yelp datasets demonstrate that POINTER achieves state-of-the-art performance on constrained text generation.

To address this challenge, we present POINTER 1 , a simple yet novel insertion-based approach for hard-constrained text generation. The proposed method operates by progressively inserting new tokens between existing tokens in a parallel manner. This procedure is recursively applied until a sequence is completed. The resulting coarse-to-fine hierarchy makes the generation process intuitive and interpretable. We pre-train our model with the proposed progressive insertion-based objective on a 12GB Wikipedia dataset, and finetune it on downstream hard-constrained generation tasks. Non-autoregressive decoding yields an empirically logarithmic time complexity during inference time.

Generation,MEGATRON-CNTRL: Controllable Story Generation with External Knowledge Using Large-Scale Language Models,"Existing pre-trained large language models have shown unparalleled generative capabilities. However, they are not controllable. In this paper, we propose MEGATRON-CNTRL, a novel framework that uses large-scale language models and adds control to text generation by incorporating an external knowledge base. Our framework consists of a keyword predictor, a knowledge retriever, a contextual knowledge ranker, and a conditional text generator. As we do not have access to groundtruth supervision for the knowledge ranker, we make use of weak supervision from sentence embedding. The empirical results show that our model generates more fluent, consistent, and coherent stories with less repetition and higher diversity compared to prior work on the ROC story dataset. We showcase the controllability of our model by replacing the keywords used to generate stories and re-running the generation process. Human evaluation results show that 77.5% of these stories are successfully controlled by the new keywords. Furthermore, by scaling our model from 124 million to 8.3 billion parameters we demonstrate that larger models improve both the quality of generation (from 74.5% to 93.0% for consistency) and controllability (from 77.5% to 91.5%).","{'sequence': 'Existing pre-trained large language models have shown unparalleled generative capabilities.

Generation,Substance over Style: Document-Level Targeted Content Transfer,"Existing language models excel at writing from scratch, but many real-world scenarios require rewriting an existing document to fit a set of constraints. Although sentence-level rewriting has been fairly well-studied, little work has addressed the challenge of rewriting an entire document coherently. In this work, we introduce the task of document-level targeted content transfer and address it in the recipe domain, with a recipe as the document and a dietary restriction (such as vegan or dairy-free) as the targeted constraint. We propose a novel model for this task based on the generative pretrained language model (GPT-2) and train on a large number of roughly-aligned recipe pairs. 1 Both automatic and human evaluations show that our model out-performs existing methods by generating coherent and diverse rewrites that obey the constraint while remaining close to the original document.

Generation,PlotMachines: Outline-Conditioned Generation with Dynamic Plot State Tracking,"We propose the task of outline-conditioned story generation: given an outline as a set of phrases that describe key characters and events to appear in a story, the task is to generate a coherent narrative that is consistent with the provided outline. This task is challenging as the input only provides a rough sketch of the plot, and thus, models need to generate a story by interweaving the key points provided in the outline. This requires the model to keep track of the dynamic states of the latent plot, conditioning on the input outline while generating the full story. We present PLOTMACHINES, a neural narrative model that learns to transform an outline into a coherent story by tracking the dynamic plot states. In addition, we enrich PLOTMACHINES with high-level discourse structure so that the model can learn different writing styles corresponding to different parts of the narrative. Comprehensive experiments over three fiction and non-fiction datasets demonstrate that large-scale language models, such as GPT-2 and GROVER, despite their impressive generation performance, are not sufficient in generating coherent narratives for the given outline, and dynamic plot state tracking is important for composing narratives with tighter, more consistent plots.","{'sequence': 'We propose the task of outline-conditioned story generation: given an outline as a set of phrases that describe key characters and events to appear in a story, the task is to generate a coherent narrative that is consistent with the provided outline.

Generation,"If beam search is the answer, what was the question?","Quite surprisingly, exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding of neural language generators frequently leads to low-quality results (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019) . Rather, most state-of-the-art results on language generation tasks are attained using beam search despite its overwhelmingly high search error rate. This implies that the MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models.

This implies that the MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. Additionally, we analyze the text produced using various decoding strategies and see that, in our neural machine translation experiments, the extent to which this property is adhered to strongly correlates with BLEU.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09055069088935852, 0.08081061393022537, 0.08041375875473022, 0.07606089860200882, 0.06396036595106125, 0.06052103638648987, 0.054903820157051086, 0.05056650564074516, 0.04883168265223503, 0.04050568491220474, 0.03942689672112465, 0.038875047117471695, 0.03874336555600166, 0.036301884800195694, 0.0333423912525177, 0.03287942335009575, 0.029733125120401382, 0.02694575861096382, 0.02319088950753212, 0.019242029637098312, 0.01581181213259697, 0.011245252564549446, 0.007136996369808912]}",0.09055069088935852,Question Answering,0.07606089860200882

Existing datasets, such as WIKIBIO, WebNLG, and E2E, basically have a good alignment between an input triple/pair set and its output text. However, in practice, the input knowledge could be more than enough, since the output description may only cover the most significant knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale and challenging dataset to facilitate the study of such a practical scenario in KG-to-text. Our dataset involves retrieving abundant knowledge of various types of main entities from a large knowledge graph (KG), which makes the current graph-to-sequence models severely suffer from the problems of information loss and parameter explosion while generating the descriptions. We address these challenges by proposing a multi-graph structure that is able to represent the original graph information more comprehensively. Furthermore, we also incorporate aggregation methods that learn to extract the rich graph information.

MOCHA contains 40K human judgement scores on model outputs from 6 diverse question answering datasets and an additional set of minimal pairs for evaluation. Using MOCHA, we train a Learned Evaluation metric for Reading Comprehension, LERC, to mimic human judgement scores. LERC outperforms baseline metrics by 10 to 36 absolute Pearson points on held-out annotations.

Humans often make structural decisions on what and how to say about before making utterances. Guiding surface realization with such high-level decisions and structuring text in a coherent way is essentially called a planning process. Where can the model learn such high-level coherence? A paragraph itself contains various forms of inductive coherence signals called self-supervision in this work, such as sentence orders, topical keywords, rhetorical structures, and so on. Motivated by that, this work proposes a new paragraph completion task PAR-COM; predicting masked sentences in a paragraph. However, the task suffers from predicting and selecting appropriate topical content with respect to the given context. To address that, we propose a self-supervised text planner SSPlanner that predicts what to say first (content prediction), then guides the pretrained language model (surface realization) using the predicted content. SSPlanner outperforms the baseline generation models on the paragraph completion task in both automatic and human evaluation. We also find that a combination of noun and verb types of keywords is the most effective for content selection. As more number of content keywords are provided, overall generation quality also increases.","{'sequence': 'Despite the recent success of contextualized language models on various NLP tasks, language model itself cannot capture textual coherence of a long, multi-sentence document (e.g., a paragraph).

Generation,Partially-Aligned Data-to-Text Generation with Distant Supervision,"The Data-to-Text task aims to generate humanreadable text for describing some given structured data enabling more interpretability. However, the typical generation task is confined to a few particular domains since it requires wellaligned data which is difficult and expensive to obtain. Using partially-aligned data is an alternative way of solving the dataset scarcity problem. This kind of data is much easier to obtain since it can be produced automatically. However, using this kind of data induces the over-generation problem posing difficulties for existing models, which tends to add unrelated excerpts during the generation procedure. In order to effectively utilize automatically annotated partially-aligned datasets, we extend the traditional generation task to a refined task called Partially-Aligned Data-to-Text Generation (PADTG) which is more practical since it utilizes automatically annotated data for training and thus considerably expands the application domains. To tackle this new task, we propose a novel distant supervision generation framework. It firstly estimates the input data's supportiveness for each target word with an estimator and then applies a supportiveness adaptor and a rebalanced beam search to harness the over-generation problem in the training and generation phases respectively. We also contribute a partially-aligned dataset 1 by sampling sentences from Wikipedia and automatically extracting corresponding KB triples for each sentence from Wikidata.

Furthermore, our model generates large improvements (46.27% ! 63.83%) in low-resource slot labeling over a BERT baseline by incorporating label semantics.

Generation,UNION: An Unreferenced Metric for Evaluating Open-ended Story Generation,"Despite the success of existing referenced metrics (e.g., BLEU and MoverScore), they correlate poorly with human judgments for openended text generation including story or dialog generation because of the notorious oneto-many issue: there are many plausible outputs for the same input, which may differ substantially in literal or semantics from the limited number of given references. To alleviate this issue, we propose UNION, a learnable UNreferenced metrIc for evaluating Open-eNded story generation, which measures the quality of a generated story without any reference. Built on top of BERT, UNION is trained to distinguish human-written stories from negative samples and recover the perturbation in negative stories. We propose an approach of constructing negative samples by mimicking the errors commonly observed in existing NLG models, including repeated plots, conflicting logic, and long-range incoherence.

Figurative language, such as a simile, goes beyond plain expressions to give readers new insights and inspirations. We tackle the problem of simile generation. Generating a simile requires proper understanding for effective mapping of properties between two concepts. To this end, we first propose a method to automatically construct a parallel corpus by transforming a large number of similes collected from Reddit to their literal counterpart using structured common sense knowledge. We then fine-tune a pretrained sequence to sequence model, BART (Lewis et al., 2019), on the literal-simile pairs to generate novel similes given a literal sentence. Experiments show that our approach generates 88% novel similes that do not share properties with the training data. Human evaluation on an independent set of literal statements shows that our model generates similes better than two literary experts 37% 1 of the times, and three baseline systems including a recent metaphor generation model 71% 2 of the times when compared pairwise. 3 We also show how replacing literal sentences with similes from our best model in machine generated stories improves evocativeness and leads to better acceptance by human judges. * The research was conducted when the author was at USC/ISI. 1 We average 32.6% and 41.3% for 2 humans. 2 We average 82% ,63% and 68% for three baselines.","{'sequence': 'Literary tropes, from poetry to stories, are at the crux of human imagination and communication.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Towards Understanding Sample Variance in Visually Grounded Language Generation: Evaluations and Observations,"A major challenge in visually grounded language generation is to build robust benchmark datasets and models that can generalize well in real-world settings. To do this, it is critical to ensure that our evaluation protocols are correct, and benchmarks are reliable. In this work, we set forth to design a set of experiments to understand an important but often ignored problem in visually grounded language generation: given that humans have different utilities and visual attention, how will the sample variance in multi-reference datasets affect the models' performance? Empirically, we study several multi-reference datasets and corresponding vision-and-language tasks. We show that it is of paramount importance to report variance in experiments; that humangenerated references could vary drastically in different datasets/tasks, revealing the nature of each task; that metric-wise, CIDEr has shown systematically larger variances than others. Our evaluations on reference-per-instance shed light on the design of reliable datasets in the future.","{'sequence': ""A major challenge in visually grounded language generation is to build robust benchmark datasets and models that can generalize well in real-world settings.

X-LXMERT's image generation capabilities rival state of the art generative models while its question answering and captioning abilities remains comparable to LXMERT.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Detecting Cross-Modal Inconsistency to Defend Against Neural Fake News,"Large-scale dissemination of disinformation online intended to mislead or deceive the general population is a major societal problem. Rapid progression in image, video, and natural language generative models has only exacerbated this situation and intensified our need for an effective defense mechanism. While existing approaches have been proposed to defend against neural fake news, they are generally constrained to the very limited setting where articles only have text and metadata such as the title and authors. In this paper, we introduce the more realistic and challenging task of defending against machine-generated news that also includes images and captions. To identify the possible weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, we create a NeuralNews dataset composed of 4 different types of generated articles as well as conduct a series of human user study experiments based on this dataset. In addition to the valuable insights gleaned from our user study, we provide a relatively effective approach based on detecting visualsemantic inconsistencies, which will serve as an effective first line of defense and a useful reference for future work in defending against machine-generated disinformation.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Visually Grounded Compound PCFGs,"Exploiting visual groundings for language understanding has recently been drawing much attention. In this work, we study visually grounded grammar induction and learn a constituency parser from both unlabeled text and its visual groundings. Existing work on this task (Shi et al., 2019) optimizes a parser via REINFORCE and derives the learning signal only from the alignment of images and sentences. While their model is relatively accurate overall, its error distribution is very uneven, with low performance on certain constituents types (e.g., 26.2% recall on verb phrases, VPs) and high on others (e.g., 79.6% recall on noun phrases, NPs). This is not surprising as the learning signal is likely insufficient for deriving all aspects of phrasestructure syntax and gradient estimates are noisy. We show that using an extension of probabilistic context-free grammar model we can do fully-differentiable end-to-end visually grounded learning. Additionally, this enables us to complement the image-text alignment loss with a language modeling objective. On the MSCOCO test captions, our model establishes a new state of the art, outperforming its non-grounded version and, thus, confirming the effectiveness of visual groundings in constituency grammar induction. It also substantially outperforms the previous grounded model, with largest improvements on more 'abstract' categories (e.g., +55.1% recall on VPs). 1","{'sequence': ""Exploiting visual groundings for language understanding has recently been drawing much attention.

We also introduce two new challenging benchmarks How2QA and How2R for Video QA and Retrieval, collected from diverse video content over multimodalities. 1', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.5016274452209473, 0.04778853431344032, 0.046500757336616516, 0.036732267588377, 0.033186376094818115, 0.02975347265601158, 0.029685726389288902, 0.025411808863282204, 0.023902032524347305, 0.021076444536447525, 0.020512016490101814, 0.02026197873055935, 0.019995901733636856, 0.01940339244902134, 0.019267488270998, 0.01838451810181141, 0.018268221989274025, 0.017010755836963654, 0.012979184277355671, 0.012692802585661411, 0.009337269701063633, 0.008951408788561821, 0.007270222529768944]}",0.5016274452209473,Question Answering,0.012692802585661411
"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",ALICE: Active Learning with Contrastive Natural Language Explanations,"Training a supervised neural network classifier typically requires many annotated training samples. Collecting and annotating a large number of data points are costly and sometimes even infeasible. Traditional annotation process uses a low-bandwidth human-machine communication interface: classification labels, each of which only provides a few bits of information. We propose Active Learning with Contrastive Explanations (ALICE), an expert-in-the-loop training framework that utilizes contrastive natural language explanations to improve data efficiency in learning. AL-ICE learns to first use active learning to select the most informative pairs of label classes to elicit contrastive natural language explanations from experts. Then it extracts knowledge from these explanations using a semantic parser. Finally, it incorporates the extracted knowledge through dynamically changing the learning model's structure. We applied ALICE in two visual recognition tasks, bird species classification and social relationship classification. We found by incorporating contrastive explanations, our models outperform baseline models that are trained with 40-100% more training data. We found that adding 1 explanation leads to similar performance gain as adding 13-30 labeled training data points.","{'sequence': ""Training a supervised neural network classifier typically requires many annotated training samples.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Sub-Instruction Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Vision-and-language navigation requires an agent to navigate through a real 3D environment following natural language instructions. Despite significant advances, few previous works are able to fully utilize the strong correspondence between the visual and textual sequences. Meanwhile, due to the lack of intermediate supervision, the agent's performance at following each part of the instruction cannot be assessed during navigation. In this work, we focus on the granularity of the visual and language sequences as well as the traceability of agents through the completion of an instruction. We provide agents with fine-grained annotations during training and find that they are able to follow the instruction better and have a higher chance of reaching the target at test time. We enrich the benchmark dataset Roomto-Room (R2R) with sub-instructions and their corresponding paths. To make use of this data, we propose effective sub-instruction attention and shifting modules that select and attend to a single sub-instruction at each time-step. We implement our sub-instruction modules in four state-of-the-art agents, compare with their baseline models, and show that our proposed method improves the performance of all four agents.","{'sequence': ""Vision-and-language navigation requires an agent to navigate through a real 3D environment following natural language instructions.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Video2Commonsense: Generating Commonsense Descriptions to Enrich Video Captioning,"Captioning is a crucial and challenging task for video understanding. In videos that involve active agents such as humans, the agent's actions can bring about myriad changes in the scene. Observable changes such as movements, manipulations, and transformations of the objects in the scene, are reflected in conventional video captioning. Unlike images, actions in videos are also inherently linked to social aspects such as intentions (why the action is taking place), effects (what changes due to the action), and attributes that describe the agent. Thus for video understanding, such as when captioning videos or when answering questions about videos, one must have an understanding of these commonsense aspects.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Learning to Represent Image and Text with Denotation Graph,"Learning to fuse vision and language information and representing them is an important research problem with many applications. Recent progresses have leveraged the ideas of pretraining (from language modeling) and attention layers in Transformers to learn representation from datasets containing images aligned with linguistic expressions that describe the images. In this paper, we propose learning representations from a set of implied, visually grounded expressions between image and text, automatically mined from those datasets. In particular, we use denotation graphs to represent how specific concepts (such as sentences describing images) can be linked to abstract and generic concepts (such as short phrases) that are also visually grounded. This type of generic-to-specific relations can be discovered using linguistic analysis tools. We propose methods to incorporate such relations into learning representation. We show that state-of-the-art multimodal learning models can be further improved by leveraging automatically harvested structural relations. The representations lead to stronger empirical results on downstream tasks of cross-modal image retrieval, referring expression, and compositional attribute-object recognition.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",SSCR: Iterative Language-Based Image Editing via Self-Supervised Counterfactual Reasoning,"Iterative Language-Based Image Editing (IL-BIE) tasks follow iterative instructions to edit images step by step. Data scarcity is a significant issue for ILBIE as it is challenging to collect large-scale examples of images before and after instruction-based changes. However, humans still accomplish these editing tasks even when presented with an unfamiliar image-instruction pair. Such ability results from counterfactual thinking and the ability to think about alternatives to events that have happened already. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Supervised Counterfactual Reasoning (SSCR) framework that incorporates counterfactual thinking to overcome data scarcity. SSCR allows the model to consider out-ofdistribution instructions paired with previous images. With the help of cross-task consistency (CTC), we train these counterfactual instructions in a self-supervised scenario. Extensive results show that SSCR improves the correctness of ILBIE in terms of both object identity and position, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA) on two IBLIE datasets (i-CLEVR and CoDraw). Even with only 50% of the training data, SSCR achieves a comparable result to using complete data.","{'sequence': 'Iterative Language-Based Image Editing (IL-BIE) tasks follow iterative instructions to edit images step by step.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Learning to Contrast the Counterfactual Samples for Robust Visual Question Answering,"In the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), most state-of-the-art models tend to learn spurious correlations in the training set and achieve poor performance in out-ofdistribution test data.

Therefore, we introduce a novel selfsupervised contrastive learning mechanism to learn the relationship between original samples, factual samples and counterfactual samples.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",MUTANT: A Training Paradigm for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Visual Question Answering,"While progress has been made on the visual question answering leaderboards, models often utilize spurious correlations and priors in datasets under the i.i.d. setting. As such, evaluation on out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples has emerged as a proxy for generalization. In this paper, we present MUTANT, a training paradigm that exposes the model to perceptually similar, yet semantically distinct mutations of the input, to improve OOD generalization, such as the VQA-CP challenge. Under this paradigm, models utilize a consistency-constrained training objective to understand the effect of semantic changes in input (question-image pair) on the output (answer). Unlike existing methods on VQA-CP, MUTANT does not rely on the knowledge about the nature of train and test answer distributions. MUTANT establishes a new state-ofthe-art accuracy on VQA-CP with a 10.57% improvement.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Does my multimodal model learn cross-modal interactions? It's harder to tell than you might think!,"Modeling expressive cross-modal interactions seems crucial in multimodal tasks, such as visual question answering. However, sometimes high-performing black-box algorithms turn out to be mostly exploiting unimodal signals in the data. We propose a new diagnostic tool, empirical multimodally-additive function projection (EMAP), for isolating whether or not cross-modal interactions improve performance for a given model on a given task. This function projection modifies model predictions so that cross-modal interactions are eliminated, isolating the additive, unimodal structure. For seven image+text classification tasks (on each of which we set new state-ofthe-art benchmarks), we find that, in many cases, removing cross-modal interactions results in little to no performance degradation. Surprisingly, this holds even when expressive models, with capacity to consider interactions, otherwise outperform less expressive models; thus, performance improvements, even when present, often cannot be attributed to consideration of cross-modal feature interactions. We hence recommend that researchers in multimodal machine learning report the performance not only of unimodal baselines, but also the EMAP of their best-performing model.","{'sequence': 'Modeling expressive cross-modal interactions seems crucial in multimodal tasks, such as visual question answering.

If ambiguous words cannot be disambiguated from context, however, this gain in efficiency might make language less clearresulting in frequent miscommunication. For a language to be clear and efficiently encoded, we posit that the lexical ambiguity of a word type should correlate with how much information context provides about it, on average. To investigate whether this is the case, we operationalise the lexical ambiguity of a word as the entropy of meanings it can take, and provide two ways to estimate this-one which requires human annotation (using WordNet), and one which does not (using BERT), making it readily applicable to a large number of languages. We validate these measures by showing that, on six high-resource languages, there are significant Pearson correlations between our BERT-based estimate of ambiguity and the number of synonyms a word has in Word-Net (e.g. ρ = 0.40 in English). We then test our main hypothesis-that a word's lexical ambiguity should negatively correlate with its contextual uncertainty-and find significant correlations on all 18 typologically diverse languages we analyse.

This dataset includes 200 unique verbs and systematically varies the definiteness and length of arguments. We use this dataset, as well as an existing corpus of naturally occurring data, to evaluate how well recent neural language models capture human preferences. Results show that larger models perform better than smaller models, and transformer architectures (e.g. GPT-2) tend to out-perform recurrent architectures (e.g. LSTMs) even under comparable parameter and training settings.

This dataset includes 200 unique verbs and systematically varies the definiteness and length of arguments. We use this dataset, as well as an existing corpus of naturally occurring data, to evaluate how well recent neural language models capture human preferences.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Word class flexibility: A deep contextualized approach,"Word class flexibility refers to the phenomenon whereby a single word form is used across different grammatical categories. Extensive work in linguistic typology has sought to characterize word class flexibility across languages, but quantifying this phenomenon accurately and at scale has been fraught with difficulties. We propose a principled methodology to explore regularity in word class flexibility. Our method builds on recent work in contextualized word embeddings to quantify semantic shift between word classes (e.g., noun-to-verb, verb-to-noun), and we apply this method to 37 languages 1 . We find that contextualized embeddings not only capture human judgment of class variation within words in English, but also uncover shared tendencies in class flexibility across languages.

We assess the ability of modern neural language models to reproduce this behavior in English and evaluate the effect of structural supervision on learning outcomes. First, we assess few-shot learning capabilities by developing controlled experiments that probe models' syntactic nominal number and verbal argument structure generalizations for tokens seen as few as two times during training. Second, we assess invariance properties of learned representation: the ability of a model to transfer syntactic generalizations from a base context (e.g., a simple declarative active-voice sentence) to a transformed context (e.g., an interrogative sentence). We test four models trained on the same dataset: an n-gram baseline, an LSTM, and two LSTM-variants trained with explicit structural supervision (Dyer et al., 2016; Charniak et al., 2016) . We find that in most cases, the neural models are able to induce the proper syntactic generalizations after minimal exposure, often from just two examples during training, and that the two structurally supervised models generalize more accurately than the LSTM model.

We show that: (1) when used out-of-the-box, pretrained models are calibrated in-domain, and compared to baselines, their calibration error out-of-domain can be as much as 3.5× lower; (2) temperature scaling is effective at further reducing calibration error in-domain, and using label smoothing to deliberately increase empirical uncertainty helps calibrate posteriors out-of-domain. 1"", 'labels': ['Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.14437709748744965, 0.1404382884502411, 0.11368470638990402, 0.0708523541688919, 0.06356415897607803, 0.054353512823581696, 0.0524665005505085, 0.038402508944272995, 0.03175286203622818, 0.03146127238869667, 0.030727576464414597, 0.02913355454802513, 0.027210451662540436, 0.026989242061972618, 0.024396773427724838, 0.019034408032894135, 0.01823434792459011, 0.017773328348994255, 0.01694898121058941, 0.01444959919899702, 0.012243079952895641, 0.011626843363046646, 0.009878503158688545]}",0.14437709748744965,Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,0.1404382884502411
Machine Learning for NLP,DyERNIE: Dynamic Evolution of Riemannian Manifold Embeddings for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion,"There has recently been increasing interest in learning representations of temporal knowledge graphs (KGs), which record the dynamic relationships between entities over time. Temporal KGs often exhibit multiple simultaneous non-Euclidean structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic structures. However, existing embedding approaches for temporal KGs typically learn entity representations and their dynamic evolution in the Euclidean space, which might not capture such intrinsic structures very well. To this end, we propose Dy-ERNIE, a non-Euclidean embedding approach that learns evolving entity representations in a product of Riemannian manifolds, where the composed spaces are estimated from the sectional curvatures of underlying data. Product manifolds enable our approach to better reflect a wide variety of geometric structures on temporal KGs. Besides, to capture the evolutionary dynamics of temporal KGs, we let the entity representations evolve according to a velocity vector defined in the tangent space at each timestamp. We analyze in detail the contribution of geometric spaces to representation learning of temporal KGs and evaluate our model on temporal knowledge graph completion tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate significantly improved performance, indicating that the dynamics of multi-relational graph data can be more properly modeled by the evolution of embeddings on Riemannian manifolds.","{'sequence': 'There has recently been increasing interest in learning representations of temporal knowledge graphs (KGs), which record the dynamic relationships between entities over time.

Machine Learning for NLP,BERT-ATTACK: Adversarial Attack Against BERT Using BERT,"Adversarial attacks for discrete data (such as texts) have been proved significantly more challenging than continuous data (such as images) since it is difficult to generate adversarial samples with gradient-based methods. Current successful attack methods for texts usually adopt heuristic replacement strategies on the character or word level, which remains challenging to find the optimal solution in the massive space of possible combinations of replacements while preserving semantic consistency and language fluency. In this paper, we propose BERT-Attack, a high-quality and effective method to generate adversarial samples using pre-trained masked language models exemplified by BERT. We turn BERT against its fine-tuned models and other deep neural models in downstream tasks so that we can successfully mislead the target models to predict incorrectly. Our method outperforms state-of-theart attack strategies in both success rate and perturb percentage, while the generated adversarial samples are fluent and semantically preserved. Also, the cost of calculation is low, thus possible for large-scale generations. The code is available at https://github.com/ LinyangLee/BERT-Attack.","{'sequence': 'Adversarial attacks for discrete data (such as texts) have been proved significantly more challenging than continuous data (such as images) since it is difficult to generate adversarial samples with gradient-based methods.

Machine Learning for NLP,Adversarial Self-Supervised Data-Free Distillation for Text Classification,"Large pre-trained transformer-based language models have achieved impressive results on a wide range of NLP tasks. In the past few years, Knowledge Distillation(KD) has become a popular paradigm to compress a computationally expensive model to a resource-efficient lightweight model. However, most KD algorithms, especially in NLP, rely on the accessibility of the original training dataset, which may be unavailable due to privacy issues. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel twostage data-free distillation method, named Adversarial self-Supervised Data-Free Distillation (AS-DFD), which is designed for compressing large-scale transformer-based models (e.g., BERT). To avoid text generation in discrete space, we introduce a Plug & Play Embedding Guessing method to craft pseudo embeddings from the teacher's hidden knowledge. Meanwhile, with a self-supervised module to quantify the student's ability, we adapt the difficulty of pseudo embeddings in an adversarial training manner.

Machine Learning for NLP,Slot Attention with Value Normalization for Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking,"Incompleteness of domain ontology and unavailability of some values are two inevitable problems of dialogue state tracking (DST). Existing approaches generally fall into two extremes: choosing models without ontology or embedding ontology in models leading to over-dependence. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to cleverly exploit ontology, which consists of Slot Attention (SA) and Value Normalization (VN), referred to as SAVN. Moreover, we supplement the annotation of supporting span for MultiWOZ 2.1, which is the shortest span in utterances to support the labeled value. SA shares knowledge between slots and utterances and only needs a simple structure to predict the supporting span. VN is designed specifically for the use of ontology, which can convert supporting spans to the values. Empirical results demonstrate that SAVN achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy of 54.52% on MultiWOZ 2.0 and 54.86% on MultiWOZ 2.1. Besides, we evaluate VN with incomplete ontology. The results show that even if only 30% ontology is used, VN can also contribute to our model.","{'sequence': 'Incompleteness of domain ontology and unavailability of some values are two inevitable problems of dialogue state tracking (DST).

Machine Learning for NLP,We Can Detect Your Bias: Predicting the Political Ideology of News Articles,"We explore the task of predicting the leading political ideology or bias of news articles. First, we collect and release a large dataset of 34,737 articles that were manually annotated for political ideology -left, center, or right-, which is well-balanced across both topics and media. We further use a challenging experimental setup where the test examples come from media that were not seen during training, which prevents the model from learning to detect the source of the target news article instead of predicting its political ideology. From a modeling perspective, we propose an adversarial media adaptation, as well as a specially adapted triplet loss. We further add background information about the source, and we show that it is quite helpful for improving article-level prediction.

Machine Learning for NLP,Semantic Label Smoothing for Sequence to Sequence Problems,"Label smoothing has been shown to be an effective regularization strategy in classification, that prevents overfitting and helps in label denoising. However, extending such methods directly to seq2seq settings, such as Machine Translation, is challenging: the large target output space of such problems makes it intractable to apply label smoothing over all possible outputs. Most existing approaches for seq2seq settings either do token level smoothing, or smooth over sequences generated by randomly substituting tokens in the target sequence. Unlike these works, in this paper, we propose a technique that smooths over well formed relevant sequences that not only have sufficient n-gram overlap with the target sequence, but are also semantically similar.

Our method shows a consistent and significant improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques on different datasets.', 'labels': ['Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Extraction', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Summarization', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07138565182685852, 0.07003924995660782, 0.06773637235164642, 0.06525058299303055, 0.06406676769256592, 0.0619344525039196, 0.053694307804107666, 0.0513317696750164, 0.05035105720162392, 0.04378193989396095, 0.039193421602249146, 0.03874404728412628, 0.03752877190709114, 0.03622853383421898, 0.03471236303448677, 0.03423478454351425, 0.031606875360012054, 0.03052397072315216, 0.02852119319140911, 0.028376968577504158, 0.025081276893615723, 0.019040321931242943, 0.016635343432426453]}",0.07138565182685852,"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",0.03052397072315216
Machine Learning for NLP,Variational Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder for Dialog State Tracking Data Augmentation,"Recent works have shown that generative data augmentation, where synthetic samples generated from deep generative models complement the training dataset, benefit NLP tasks. In this work, we extend this approach to the task of dialog state tracking for goaloriented dialogs. Due to the inherent hierarchical structure of goal-oriented dialogs over utterances and related annotations, the deep generative model must be capable of capturing the coherence among different hierarchies and types of dialog features. We propose the Variational Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder (VHDA) for modeling the complete aspects of goal-oriented dialogs, including linguistic features and underlying structured annotations, namely speaker information, dialog acts, and goals. The proposed architecture is designed to model each aspect of goal-oriented dialogs using inter-connected latent variables and learns to generate coherent goal-oriented dialogs from the latent spaces. To overcome training issues that arise from training complex variational models, we propose appropriate training strategies. Experiments on various dialog datasets show that our model improves the downstream dialog trackers' robustness via generative data augmentation. We also discover additional benefits of our unified approach to modeling goal-oriented dialogsdialog response generation and user simulation, where our model outperforms previous strong baselines.","{'sequence': ""Recent works have shown that generative data augmentation, where synthetic samples generated from deep generative models complement the training dataset, benefit NLP tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,SSMBA: Self-Supervised Manifold Based Data Augmentation for Improving Out-of-Domain Robustness,"Models that perform well on a training domain often fail to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) examples. Data augmentation is a common method used to prevent overfitting and improve OOD generalization.

Machine Learning for NLP,T3: Tree-Autoencoder Constrained Adversarial Text Generation for Targeted Attack,"Adversarial attacks against natural language processing systems, which perform seemingly innocuous modifications to inputs, can induce arbitrary mistakes to the target models. Though raised great concerns, such adversarial attacks can be leveraged to estimate the robustness of NLP models. Compared with the adversarial example generation in continuous data domain (e.g., image), generating adversarial text that preserves the original meaning is challenging since the text space is discrete and non-differentiable. To handle these challenges, we propose a target-controllable adversarial attack framework T3, which is applicable to a range of NLP tasks. In particular, we propose a tree-based autoencoder to embed the discrete text data into a continuous representation space, upon which we optimize the adversarial perturbation. A novel tree-based decoder is then applied to regularize the syntactic correctness of the generated text and manipulate it on either sentence (T3(SENT)) or word (T3(WORD)) level. We consider two most representative NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and question answering (QA). Extensive experimental results and human studies show that T3 generated adversarial texts can successfully manipulate the NLP models to output the targeted incorrect answer without misleading the human. Moreover, we show that the generated adversarial texts have high transferability which enables the black-box attacks in practice. Our work sheds light on an effective and general way to examine the robustness of NLP models.

Machine Learning for NLP,Efficient Meta Lifelong-Learning with Limited Memory,"Current natural language processing models work well on a single task, yet they often fail to continuously learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones as they are re-trained throughout their lifetime, a challenge known as lifelong learning. State-of-the-art lifelong language learning methods store past examples in episodic memory and replay them at both training and inference time. However, as we show later in our experiments, there are three significant impediments: (1) needing unrealistically large memory module to achieve good performance, (2) suffering from negative transfer, (3) requiring multiple local adaptation steps for each test example that significantly slows down the inference speed. In this paper, we identify three common principles of lifelong learning methods and propose an efficient meta-lifelong framework that combines them in a synergistic fashion. To achieve sample efficiency, our method trains the model in a manner that it learns a better initialization for local adaptation. Extensive experiments on text classification and question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by achieving state-of-the-art performance using merely 1% memory size and narrowing the gap with multi-task learning.

Machine Learning for NLP,Repulsive Attention: Rethinking Multi-head Attention as Bayesian Inference,"The neural attention mechanism plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model's representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective.

In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model's representation power.

Machine Learning for NLP,The Thieves on Sesame Street are Polyglots - Extracting Multilingual Models from Monolingual APIs,"Pre-training in natural language processing makes it easier for an adversary with only query access to a victim model to reconstruct a local copy of the victim by training with gibberish input data paired with the victim's labels for that data. We discover that this extraction process extends to local copies initialized from a pre-trained, multilingual model while the victim remains monolingual. The extracted model learns the task from the monolingual victim, but it generalizes far better than the victim to several other languages. This is done without ever showing the multilingual, extracted model a well-formed input in any of the languages for the target task.

Machine Learning for NLP,Word Rotator's Distance,"A key principle in assessing textual similarity is measuring the degree of semantic overlap between two texts by considering the word alignment. Such alignment-based approaches are intuitive and interpretable; however, they are empirically inferior to the simple cosine similarity between general-purpose sentence vectors. To address this issue, we focus on and demonstrate the fact that the norm of word vectors is a good proxy for word importance, and their angle is a good proxy for word similarity. Alignment-based approaches do not distinguish them, whereas sentence-vector approaches automatically use the norm as the word importance. Accordingly, we propose a method that first decouples word vectors into their norm and direction, and then computes alignment-based similarity using earth mover's distance (i.e., optimal transport cost), which we refer to as word rotator's distance. Besides, we find how to ""grow"" the norm and direction of word vectors (vector converter), which is a new systematic approach derived from sentence-vector estimation methods.

Machine Learning for NLP,Learning Explainable Linguistic Expressions with Neural Inductive Logic Programming for Sentence Classification,"Interpretability of predictive models is becoming increasingly important with growing adoption in the real-world. We present RuleNN, a neural network architecture for learning transparent models for sentence classification. The models are in the form of rules expressed in first-order logic, a dialect with well-defined, human-understandable semantics. More precisely, RuleNN learns linguistic expressions (LE) built on top of predicates extracted using shallow natural language understanding. Our experimental results show that RuleNN outperforms statistical relational learning and other neuro-symbolic methods, and performs comparably with black-box recurrent neural networks. Our user studies confirm that the learned LEs are explainable and capture domain semantics. Moreover, allowing domain experts to modify LEs and instill more domain knowledge leads to human-machine cocreation of models with better performance.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Simple Approach to Learning Unsupervised Multilingual Embeddings,"Recent progress on unsupervised cross-lingual embeddings in the bilingual setting has given the impetus to learning a shared embedding space for several languages. A popular framework to solve the latter problem is to solve the following two sub-problems jointly: 1) learning unsupervised word alignment between several language pairs, and 2) learning how to map the monolingual embeddings of every language to shared multilingual space. In contrast, we propose a simple approach by decoupling the above two sub-problems and solving them separately, one after another, using existing techniques. We show that this proposed approach obtains surprisingly good performance in tasks such as bilingual lexicon induction, cross-lingual word similarity, multilingual document classification, and multilingual dependency parsing.

Machine Learning for NLP,Grounded Compositional Outputs for Adaptive Language Modeling,"Language models have emerged as a central component across NLP, and a great deal of progress depends on the ability to cheaply adapt them (e.g., through finetuning) to new domains and tasks. A language model's vocabulary-typically selected before training and permanently fixed later-affects its size and is part of what makes it resistant to such adaptation. Prior work has used compositional input embeddings based on surface forms to ameliorate this issue. In this work, we go one step beyond and propose a fully compositional output embedding layer for language models, which is further grounded in information from a structured lexicon (WordNet), namely semantically related words and free-text definitions. To our knowledge, the result is the first word-level language model with a size that does not depend on the training vocabulary. We evaluate the model on conventional language modeling as well as challenging cross-domain settings with an open vocabulary, finding that it matches or outperforms previous state-of-theart output embedding methods and adaptation approaches.

Machine Learning for NLP,Structure Aware Negative Sampling in Knowledge Graphs,"Learning low-dimensional representations for entities and relations in knowledge graphs using contrastive estimation represents a scalable and effective method for inferring connectivity patterns. A crucial aspect of contrastive learning approaches is the choice of corruption distribution that generates hard negative samples, which force the embedding model to learn discriminative representations and find critical characteristics of observed data. While earlier methods either employ too simple corruption distributions, i.e. uniform, yielding easy uninformative negatives or sophisticated adversarial distributions with challenging optimization schemes, they do not explicitly incorporate known graph structure resulting in suboptimal negatives. In this paper, we propose Structure Aware Negative Sampling (SANS), an inexpensive negative sampling strategy that utilizes the rich graph structure by selecting negative samples from a node's k-hop neighborhood. Empirically, we demonstrate that SANS finds semantically meaningful negatives and is competitive with SOTA approaches while requires no additional parameters nor difficult adversarial optimization.","{'sequence': ""Learning low-dimensional representations for entities and relations in knowledge graphs using contrastive estimation represents a scalable and effective method for inferring connectivity patterns.

Machine Learning for NLP,Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Natural Language Classification Tasks,"Self-supervised pre-training of transformer models has revolutionized NLP applications. Such pre-training with language modeling objectives provides a useful initial point for parameters that generalize well to new tasks with fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is still data inefficient -when there are few labeled examples, accuracy can be low. Data efficiency can be improved by optimizing pre-training directly for future fine-tuning with few examples; this can be treated as a meta-learning problem. However, standard meta-learning techniques require many training tasks in order to generalize; unfortunately, finding a diverse set of such supervised tasks is usually difficult. This paper proposes a self-supervised approach to generate a large, rich, metalearning task distribution from unlabeled text. This is achieved using a cloze-style objective, but creating separate multi-class classification tasks by gathering tokens-to-be blanked from among only a handful of vocabulary terms. This yields as many unique meta-training tasks as the number of subsets of vocabulary terms. We meta-train a transformer model on this distribution of tasks using a recent meta-learning framework. On 17 NLP tasks, we show that this meta-training leads to better few-shot generalization than language-model pre-training followed by finetuning. Furthermore, we show how the self-supervised tasks can be combined with supervised tasks for meta-learning, providing substantial accuracy gains over previous supervised meta-learning.","{'sequence': 'Self-supervised pre-training of transformer models has revolutionized NLP applications.

Machine Learning for NLP,DORB: Dynamically Optimizing Multiple Rewards with Bandits,"Policy gradients-based reinforcement learning has proven to be a promising approach for directly optimizing non-differentiable evaluation metrics for language generation tasks. However, optimizing for a specific metric reward leads to improvements in mostly that metric only, suggesting that the model is gaming the formulation of that metric in a particular way without often achieving real qualitative improvements. Hence, it is more beneficial to make the model optimize multiple diverse metric rewards jointly. While appealing, this is challenging because one needs to manually decide the importance and scaling weights of these metric rewards. Further, it is important to consider using a dynamic combination and curriculum of metric rewards that flexibly changes over time. Considering the above aspects, in our work, we automate the optimization of multiple metric rewards simultaneously via a multi-armed bandit approach (DORB), where at each round, the bandit chooses which metric reward to optimize next, based on expected arm gains. We use the Exp3 algorithm for bandits and formulate two approaches for bandit rewards: (1) Single Multi-reward Bandit (SM-Bandit); (2) Hierarchical Multi-reward Bandit (HM-Bandit). We empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches via various automatic metrics and human evaluation on two important NLG tasks: question generation and data-to-text generation. Finally, we present interpretable analyses of the learned bandit curriculum over the optimized rewards.","{'sequence': 'Policy gradients-based reinforcement learning has proven to be a promising approach for directly optimizing non-differentiable evaluation metrics for language generation tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Exploring and Predicting Transferability across NLP Tasks,"Recent advances in NLP demonstrate the effectiveness of training large-scale language models and transferring them to downstream tasks. Can fine-tuning these models on tasks other than language modeling further improve performance? In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of the transferability between 33 NLP tasks across three broad classes of problems (text classification, question answering, and sequence labeling). Our results show that transfer learning is more beneficial than previously thought, especially when target task data is scarce, and can improve performance even with low-data source tasks that differ substantially from the target task (e.g., part-ofspeech tagging transfers well to the DROP QA dataset). We also develop task embeddings that can be used to predict the most transferable source tasks for a given target task, and we validate their effectiveness in experiments controlled for source and target data size. Overall, our experiments reveal that factors such as data size, task and domain similarity, and task complexity all play a role in determining transferability.","{'sequence': 'Recent advances in NLP demonstrate the effectiveness of training large-scale language models and transferring them to downstream tasks.

For text normalization, sentence fusion, and grammatical error correction, our approach improves explainability by associating each edit operation with a human-readable tag.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'NLP Applications', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10776934027671814, 0.08082569390535355, 0.06828448176383972, 0.0635557770729065, 0.06121320649981499, 0.0597846582531929, 0.055171217769384384, 0.05257253721356392, 0.047799814492464066, 0.04544597119092941, 0.04374320060014725, 0.037613045424222946, 0.034538883715867996, 0.034434009343385696, 0.0338687039911747, 0.03139878436923027, 0.029574068263173103, 0.027886448428034782, 0.027050361037254333, 0.017640601843595505, 0.015121931210160255, 0.014356106519699097, 0.0103511493653059]}",0.10776934027671814,Resources and Evaluation,0.06828448176383972
Machine Learning for NLP,Imitation Attacks and Defenses for Black-box Machine Translation Systems,"Adversaries may look to steal or attack blackbox NLP systems, either for financial gain or to exploit model errors. One setting of particular interest is machine translation (MT), where models have high commercial value and errors can be costly. We investigate possible exploitations of black-box MT systems and explore a preliminary defense against such threats. We first show that MT systems can be stolen by querying them with monolingual sentences and training models to imitate their outputs. Using simulated experiments, we demonstrate that MT model stealing is possible even when imitation models have different input data or architectures than their target models. Applying these ideas, we train imitation models that reach within 0.6 BLEU of three production MT systems on both high-resource and low-resource language pairs. We then leverage the similarity of our imitation models to transfer adversarial examples to the production systems. We use gradient-based attacks that expose inputs which lead to semanticallyincorrect translations, dropped content, and vulgar model outputs. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a defense that modifies translation outputs in order to misdirect the optimization of imitation models. This defense degrades the adversary's BLEU score and attack success rate at some cost in the defender's BLEU and inference speed. Transfer Solve Eq.

Machine Learning for NLP,Contrastive Distillation on Intermediate Representations for Language Model Compression,"Existing language model compression methods mostly use a simple L 2 loss to distill knowledge in the intermediate representations of a large BERT model to a smaller one. Although widely used, this objective by design assumes that all the dimensions of hidden representations are independent, failing to capture important structural knowledge in the intermediate layers of the teacher network. To achieve better distillation efficacy, we propose Contrastive Distillation on Intermediate Representations (CODIR), a principled knowledge distillation framework where the student is trained to distill knowledge through intermediate layers of the teacher via a contrastive objective.

In contrast, humans can solve new tasks by reading some instructions, with perhaps an example or two. To take a step toward closing this gap, we introduce a framework for developing NLP systems that solve new tasks after reading their descriptions, synthesizing prior work in this area. We instantiate this framework with a new English language dataset, ZEST, structured for task-oriented evaluation on unseen tasks. Formulating task descriptions as questions, we ensure each is general enough to apply to many possible inputs, thus comprehensively evaluating a model's ability to solve each task.

Machine Learning for NLP,Transformer Based Multi-Source Domain Adaptation,"In practical machine learning settings, the data on which a model must make predictions often come from a different distribution than the data it was trained on. Here, we investigate the problem of unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation, where a model is trained on labelled data from multiple source domains and must make predictions on a domain for which no labelled data has been seen. Prior work with CNNs and RNNs has demonstrated the benefit of mixture of experts, where the predictions of multiple domain expert classifiers are combined; as well as domain adversarial training, to induce a domain agnostic representation space. Inspired by this, we investigate how such methods can be effectively applied to large pretrained transformer models. We find that domain adversarial training has an effect on the learned representations of these models while having little effect on their performance, suggesting that large transformer-based models are already relatively robust across domains. Additionally, we show that mixture of experts leads to significant performance improvements by comparing several variants of mixing functions, including one novel mixture based on attention.

Machine Learning for NLP,Structured Pruning of Large Language Models,"Large language models have recently achieved state of the art performance across a wide variety of natural language tasks. Meanwhile, the size of these models and their latency have significantly increased, which makes their usage costly, and raises an interesting question: do language models need to be large? We study this question through the lens of model compression.

Machine Learning for NLP,Understanding the Mechanics of SPIGOT: Surrogate Gradients for Latent Structure Learning,"Latent structure models are a powerful tool for modeling language data: they can mitigate the error propagation and annotation bottleneck in pipeline systems, while simultaneously uncovering linguistic insights about the data. One challenge with end-to-end training of these models is the argmax operation, which has null gradient. In this paper, we focus on surrogate gradients, a popular strategy to deal with this problem. We explore latent structure learning through the angle of pulling back the downstream learning objective. In this paradigm, we discover a principled motivation for both the straight-through estimator (STE) as well as the recently-proposed SPIGOT-a variant of STE for structured models. Our perspective leads to new algorithms in the same family.

Machine Learning for NLP,Recall and Learn: Fine-tuning Deep Pretrained Language Models with Less Forgetting,"Deep pretrained language models have achieved great success in the way of pretraining first and then fine-tuning. But such a sequential transfer learning paradigm often confronts the catastrophic forgetting problem and leads to sub-optimal performance. To fine-tune with less forgetting, we propose a recall and learn mechanism, which adopts the idea of multi-task learning and jointly learns pretraining tasks and downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Pretraining Simulation mechanism to recall the knowledge from pretraining tasks without data, and an Objective Shifting mechanism to focus the learning on downstream tasks gradually. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GLUE benchmark. Our method also enables BERTbase to achieve better average performance than directly fine-tuning of BERT-large.

We create a benchmark dataset of transcriptions for scanned books in three critically endangered languages and present a systematic analysis of how general-purpose OCR tools are not robust to the data-scarce setting of endangered languages. We develop an OCR postcorrection method tailored to ease training in this data-scarce setting, reducing the recognition error rate by 34% on average across the three languages.', 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Summarization', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.11608871072530746, 0.0778987780213356, 0.07020869106054306, 0.06891722232103348, 0.06746545433998108, 0.06442414969205856, 0.05459754914045334, 0.053408365696668625, 0.05003451928496361, 0.048881739377975464, 0.04056878387928009, 0.03653062880039215, 0.035649772733449936, 0.033839065581560135, 0.03304491564631462, 0.031850676983594894, 0.022924337536096573, 0.021552059799432755, 0.01897621899843216, 0.017646603286266327, 0.013260719366371632, 0.013245489448308945, 0.008985613472759724]}",0.11608871072530746,Information Extraction,0.048881739377975464
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamic Context Selection for Document-level Neural Machine Translation via Reinforcement Learning,"Document-level neural machine translation has yielded attractive improvements. However, majority of existing methods roughly use all context sentences in a fixed scope. They neglect the fact that different source sentences need different sizes of context. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to select dynamic context so that the document-level translation model can utilize the more useful selected context sentences to produce better translations. Specifically, we introduce a selection module that is independent of the translation module to score each candidate context sentence. Then, we propose two strategies to explicitly select a variable number of context sentences and feed them into the translation module. We train the two modules end-to-end via reinforcement learning. A novel reward is proposed to encourage the selection and utilization of dynamic context sentences. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can select adaptive context sentences for different source sentences, and significantly improves the performance of document-level translation methods.","{'sequence': 'Document-level neural machine translation has yielded attractive improvements.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,From Zero to Hero: On the Limitations of Zero-Shot Language Transfer with Multilingual Transformers,"Massively multilingual transformers (MMTs) pretrained via language modeling (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) have become a default paradigm for zero-shot language transfer in NLP, offering unmatched transfer performance. Current evaluations, however, verify their efficacy in transfers (a) to languages with sufficiently large pretraining corpora, and (b) between close languages. In this work, we analyze the limitations of downstream language transfer with MMTs, showing that, much like cross-lingual word embeddings, they are substantially less effective in resource-lean scenarios and for distant languages. Our experiments, encompassing three lower-level tasks (POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER) and two high-level tasks (NLI, QA), empirically correlate transfer performance with linguistic proximity between source and target languages, but also with the size of target language corpora used in MMT pretraining. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the inexpensive few-shot transfer (i.e., additional fine-tuning on a few target-language instances) is surprisingly effective across the board, warranting more research efforts reaching beyond the limiting zero-shot conditions.","{'sequence': 'Massively multilingual transformers (MMTs) pretrained via language modeling (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) have become a default paradigm for zero-shot language transfer in NLP, offering unmatched transfer performance.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,LNMap: Departures from Isomorphic Assumption in Bilingual Lexicon Induction Through Non-Linear Mapping in Latent Space,"Most of the successful and predominant methods for Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) are mapping-based, where a linear mapping function is learned with the assumption that the word embedding spaces of different languages exhibit similar geometric structures (i.e., approximately isomorphic). However, several recent studies have criticized this simplified assumption showing that it does not hold in general even for closely related languages. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised method to learn cross-lingual word embeddings for BLI. Our model is independent of the isomorphic assumption and uses non-linear mapping in the latent space of two independently pre-trained autoencoders. Through extensive experiments on fifteen (15) different language pairs (in both directions) comprising resource-rich and low-resource languages from two different datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models by a good margin.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Data Rejuvenation: Exploiting Inactive Training Examples for Neural Machine Translation,"Large-scale training datasets lie at the core of the recent success of neural machine translation (NMT) models. However, the complex patterns and potential noises in the large-scale data make training NMT models difficult. In this work, we explore to identify the inactive training examples which contribute less to the model performance, and show that the existence of inactive examples depends on the data distribution. We further introduce data rejuvenation to improve the training of NMT models on large-scale datasets by exploiting inactive examples. The proposed framework consists of three phases. First, we train an identification model on the original training data, and use it to distinguish inactive examples and active examples by their sentence-level output probabilities. Then, we train a rejuvenation model on the active examples, which is used to re-label the inactive examples with forwardtranslation. Finally, the rejuvenated examples and the active examples are combined to train the final NMT model. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and English-French datasets show that the proposed data rejuvenation consistently and significantly improves performance for several strong NMT models. Extensive analyses reveal that our approach stabilizes and accelerates the training process of NMT models, resulting in final models with better generalization capability. 1","{'sequence': 'Large-scale training datasets lie at the core of the recent success of neural machine translation (NMT) models.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Do Explicit Alignments Robustly Improve Multilingual Encoders?,"Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019,  mBERT), XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al.,  2019, XLMR)  and other unsupervised multilingual encoders can effectively learn crosslingual representation. Explicit alignment objectives based on bitexts like Europarl or Mul-tiUN have been shown to further improve these representations.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,X-FACTR: Multilingual Factual Knowledge Retrieval from Pretrained Language Models,"Language models (LMs) have proven surprisingly successful at capturing factual knowledge by completing cloze-style fill-in-theblank questions such as ""Punta Cana is located in _."" However, while knowledge is both written and queried in many languages, studies on LMs' factual representation ability have almost invariably been performed on English. To assess factual knowledge retrieval in LMs in different languages, we create a multilingual benchmark of cloze-style probes for 23 typologically diverse languages. To properly handle language variations, we expand probing methods from single-to multi-word entities, and develop several decoding algorithms to generate multi-token predictions. Extensive experimental results provide insights about how well (or poorly) current state-of-theart LMs perform at this task in languages with more or fewer available resources. We further propose a code-switching-based method to improve the ability of multilingual LMs to access knowledge, and verify its effectiveness on several benchmark languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Iterative Refinement in the Continuous Space for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"We propose an efficient inference procedure for non-autoregressive machine translation that iteratively refines translation purely in the continuous space. Given a continuous latent variable model for machine translation (Shu et al., 2020) , we train an inference network to approximate the gradient of the marginal log probability of the target sentence, using only the latent variable as input. This allows us to use gradient-based optimization to find the target sentence at inference time that approximately maximizes its marginal probability. As each refinement step only involves computation in the latent space of low dimensionality (we use 8 in our experiments), we avoid computational overhead incurred by existing non-autoregressive inference procedures that often refine in token space. We compare our approach to a recently proposed EM-like inference procedure (Shu et al., 2020 ) that optimizes in a hybrid space, consisting of both discrete and continuous variables. We evaluate our approach on WMT'14 En→De, WMT'16 Ro→En and IWSLT'16 De→En, and observe two advantages over the EM-like inference: (1) it is computationally efficient, i.e. each refinement step is twice as fast, and (2) it is more effective, resulting in higher marginal probabilities and BLEU scores with the same number of refinement steps. On WMT'14 En→De, for instance, our approach is able to decode 6.2 times faster than the autoregressive model with minimal degradation to translation quality (0.9 BLEU).","{'sequence': ""We propose an efficient inference procedure for non-autoregressive machine translation that iteratively refines translation purely in the continuous space.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Accurate Word Alignment Induction from Neural Machine Translation,"Despite its original goal to jointly learn to align and translate, prior researches suggest that Transformer captures poor word alignments through its attention mechanism. In this paper, we show that attention weights DO capture accurate word alignments and propose two novel word alignment induction methods SHIFT-ATT and SHIFT-AET. The main idea is to induce alignments at the step when the to-be-aligned target token is the decoder input rather than the decoder output as in previous work. SHIFT-ATT is an interpretation method that induces alignments from the attention weights of Transformer and does not require parameter update or architecture change. SHIFT-AET extracts alignments from an additional alignment module which is tightly integrated into Transformer and trained in isolation with supervision from symmetrized SHIFT-ATT alignments. Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that both methods perform better than their corresponding neural baselines and SHIFT-AET significantly outperforms GIZA++ by 1.4-4.8 AER points. 1","{'sequence': 'Despite its original goal to jointly learn to align and translate, prior researches suggest that Transformer captures poor word alignments through its attention mechanism.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,CSP:Code-Switching Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation,"This paper proposes a new pre-training method, called Code-Switching Pre-training (CSP for short) for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Unlike traditional pre-training method which randomly masks some fragments of the input sentence, the proposed CSP randomly replaces some words in the source sentence with their translation words in the target language. Specifically, we firstly perform lexicon induction with unsupervised word embedding mapping between the source and target languages, and then randomly replace some words in the input sentence with their translation words according to the extracted translation lexicons. CSP adopts the encoderdecoder framework: its encoder takes the codemixed sentence as input, and its decoder predicts the replaced fragment of the input sentence. In this way, CSP is able to pre-train the NMT model by explicitly making the most of the cross-lingual alignment information extracted from the source and target monolingual corpus. Additionally, we relieve the pretrainfinetune discrepancy caused by the artificial symbols like [mask]. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on unsupervised and supervised NMT. Experimental results show that CSP achieves significant improvements over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods.","{'sequence': 'This paper proposes a new pre-training method, called Code-Switching Pre-training (CSP for short) for Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Towards Enhancing Faithfulness for Neural Machine Translation,"Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great success due to the ability to generate high-quality sentences.

In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy with a multi-task learning paradigm to build a faithfulness enhanced NMT model (named FENMT). During the NMT training process, we sample a subset from the training set and translate them to get fragments that have been mistranslated. Afterward, the proposed multi-task learning paradigm is employed on both encoder and decoder to guide NMT to correctly translate these fragments.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Supervised Word Alignment Method based on Cross-Language Span Prediction using Multilingual BERT,"We present a novel supervised word alignment method based on cross-language span prediction. We first formalize a word alignment problem as a collection of independent predictions from a token in the source sentence to a span in the target sentence. Since this step is equivalent to a SQuAD v2.0 style question answering task, we solve it using the multilingual BERT, which is fine-tuned on manually created gold word alignment data. It is nontrivial to obtain accurate alignment from a set of independently predicted spans. We greatly improved the word alignment accuracy by adding to the question the source token's context and symmetrizing two directional predictions. In experiments using five word alignment datasets from among Chinese, Japanese, German, Romanian, French, and English, we show that our proposed method significantly outperformed previous supervised and unsupervised word alignment methods without any bitexts for pretraining. For example, we achieved 86.7 F1 score for the Chinese-English data, which is 13.3 points higher than the previous state-of-the-art supervised method. 1","{'sequence': ""We present a novel supervised word alignment method based on cross-language span prediction.

For example, we achieved 86.7 F1 score for the Chinese-English data, which is 13.3 points higher than the previous state-of-the-art supervised method. 1"", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.2552870810031891, 0.06969070434570312, 0.0629258006811142, 0.058276087045669556, 0.04828770458698273, 0.046494707465171814, 0.04607684537768364, 0.04590678960084915, 0.039104804396629333, 0.0357031486928463, 0.03547069430351257, 0.03277741000056267, 0.03054814226925373, 0.029425393790006638, 0.0228180643171072, 0.022673960775136948, 0.022192873060703278, 0.020320286974310875, 0.018149109557271004, 0.016389187425374985, 0.015927394852042198, 0.0129393944516778, 0.01261446624994278]}",0.2552870810031891,Question Answering,0.0357031486928463
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Learn to Cross-lingual Transfer with Meta Graph Learning Across Heterogeneous Languages,"The recent emergence of multilingual pretraining language model (mPLM) has enabled breakthroughs on various downstream crosslingual transfer (CLT) tasks. However, mPLMbased methods usually involve two problems: (1) simply fine-tuning may not adapt generalpurpose multilingual representations to be task-aware on low-resource languages; (2) ignore how cross-lingual adaptation happens for downstream tasks. To address the issues, we propose a meta graph learning (MGL) method. Unlike prior works that transfer from scratch, MGL can learn to cross-lingual transfer by extracting meta-knowledge from historical CLT experiences (tasks), making mPLM insensitive to low-resource languages. Besides, for each CLT task, MGL formulates its transfer process as information propagation over a dynamic graph, where the geometric structure can automatically capture intrinsic language relationships to guide cross-lingual transfer explicitly. Empirically, extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the MGL method. * The work was done when Zheng Li was an intern at Amazon.com Inc.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation,"As a sequence-to-sequence generation task, neural machine translation (NMT) naturally contains intrinsic uncertainty, where a single sentence in one language has multiple valid counterparts in the other.

This leads to a discrepancy of the data distribution between the training and the inference phases.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Iterative Domain-Repaired Back-Translation,"In this paper, we focus on the domain-specific translation with low resources, where indomain parallel corpora are scarce or nonexistent.

To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative domain-repaired back-translation framework, which introduces the Domain-Repair (DR) model to refine translations in synthetic bilingual data.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Pre-training Multilingual Neural Machine Translation by Leveraging Alignment Information,"We investigate the following question for machine translation (MT): can we develop a single universal MT model to serve as the common seed and obtain derivative and improved models on arbitrary language pairs? We propose mRASP, an approach to pre-train a universal multilingual neural machine translation model. Our key idea in mRASP is its novel technique of random aligned substitution, which brings words and phrases with similar meanings across multiple languages closer in the representation space. We pre-train a mRASP model on 32 language pairs jointly with only public datasets. The model is then fine-tuned on downstream language pairs to obtain specialized MT models. We carry out extensive experiments on 42 translation directions across a diverse settings, including low, medium, rich resource, and as well as transferring to exotic language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that mRASP achieves significant performance improvement compared to directly training on those target pairs. It is the first time to verify that multiple lowresource language pairs can be utilized to improve rich resource MT. Surprisingly, mRASP is even able to improve the translation quality on exotic languages that never occur in the pretraining corpus.

Our key idea in mRASP is its novel technique of random aligned substitution, which brings words and phrases with similar meanings across multiple languages closer in the representation space. We pre-train a mRASP model on 32 language pairs jointly with only public datasets. The model is then fine-tuned on downstream language pairs to obtain specialized MT models. We carry out extensive experiments on 42 translation directions across a diverse settings, including low, medium, rich resource, and as well as transferring to exotic language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that mRASP achieves significant performance improvement compared to directly training on those target pairs. It is the first time to verify that multiple lowresource language pairs can be utilized to improve rich resource MT. Surprisingly, mRASP is even able to improve the translation quality on exotic languages that never occur in the pretraining corpus.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Making Monolingual Sentence Embeddings Multilingual using Knowledge Distillation,"We present an easy and efficient method to extend existing sentence embedding models to new languages. This allows to create multilingual versions from previously monolingual models. The training is based on the idea that a translated sentence should be mapped to the same location in the vector space as the original sentence. We use the original (monolingual) model to generate sentence embeddings for the source language and then train a new system on translated sentences to mimic the original model. Compared to other methods for training multilingual sentence embeddings, this approach has several advantages: It is easy to extend existing models with relatively few samples to new languages, it is easier to ensure desired properties for the vector space, and the hardware requirements for training are lower. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 50+ languages from various language families. Code to extend sentence embeddings models to more than 400 languages is publicly available. 1","{'sequence': 'We present an easy and efficient method to extend existing sentence embedding models to new languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer with Meta Learning,"Learning what to share between tasks has become a topic of great importance, as strategic sharing of knowledge has been shown to improve downstream task performance. This is particularly important for multilingual applications, as most languages in the world are under-resourced. Here, we consider the setting of training models on multiple different languages at the same time, when little or no data is available for languages other than English. We show that this challenging setup can be approached using meta-learning: in addition to training a source language model, another model learns to select which training instances are the most beneficial to the first. We experiment using standard supervised, zero-shot cross-lingual, as well as fewshot cross-lingual settings for different natural language understanding tasks (natural language inference, question answering). Our extensive experimental setup demonstrates the consistent effectiveness of meta-learning for a total of 15 languages. We improve upon the state-of-the-art for zero-shot and few-shot NLI (on MultiNLI and XNLI) and QA (on the MLQA dataset). A comprehensive error analysis indicates that the correlation of typological features between languages can partly explain when parameter sharing learned via meta-learning is beneficial.","{'sequence': 'Learning what to share between tasks has become a topic of great importance, as strategic sharing of knowledge has been shown to improve downstream task performance.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Can Automatic Post-Editing Improve NMT?,"Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to improve machine translations, thereby reducing human post-editing effort. APE has had notable success when used with statistical machine translation (SMT) systems but has not been as successful over neural machine translation (NMT) systems. This has raised questions on the relevance of APE task in the current scenario. However, the training of APE models has been heavily reliant on large-scale artificial corpora combined with only limited human post-edited data. We hypothesize that APE models have been underperforming in improving NMT translations due to the lack of adequate supervision. To ascertain our hypothesis, we compile a larger corpus of human post-edits of English to German NMT. We empirically show that a state-of-art neural APE model trained on this corpus can significantly improve a strong in-domain NMT system, challenging the current understanding in the field. We further investigate the effects of varying training data sizes, using artificial training data, and domain specificity for the APE task.

In this paper, we propose to generate diverse translations by deriving a large number of possible models with Bayesian modelling and sampling models from them for inference. The possible models are obtained by applying concrete dropout to the NMT model and each of them has specific confidence for its prediction, which corresponds to a posterior model distribution under specific training data in the principle of Bayesian modeling. With variational inference, the posterior model distribution can be approximated with a variational distribution, from which the final models for inference are sampled.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Don't Use English Dev: On the Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Evaluation of Contextual Embeddings,"Multilingual contextual embeddings have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning, where multilingual BERT is fine-tuned on one source language and evaluated on a different target language. However, published results for mBERT zero-shot accuracy vary as much as 17 points on the MLDoc classification task across four papers. We show that the standard practice of using English dev accuracy for model selection in the zero-shot setting makes it difficult to obtain reproducible results on the MLDoc and XNLI tasks. English dev accuracy is often uncorrelated (or even anti-correlated) with target language accuracy, and zero-shot performance varies greatly at different points in the same fine-tuning run and between different fine-tuning runs. These reproducibility issues are also present for other tasks with different pre-trained embeddings (e.g., MLQA with XLM-R). We recommend providing oracle scores alongside zero-shot results: still fine-tune using English data, but choose a checkpoint with the target dev set. Reporting this upper bound makes results more consistent by avoiding arbitrarily bad checkpoints.","{'sequence': 'Multilingual contextual embeddings have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning, where multilingual BERT is fine-tuned on one source language and evaluated on a different target language.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation in Many Languages via Zero-Shot Paraphrasing,"We frame the task of machine translation evaluation as one of scoring machine translation output with a sequence-to-sequence paraphraser, conditioned on a human reference. We propose training the paraphraser as a multilingual NMT system, treating paraphrasing as a zero-shot translation task (e.g., Czech to Czech). This results in the paraphraser's output mode being centered around a copy of the input sequence, which represents the best case scenario where the MT system output matches a human reference. Our method is simple and intuitive, and does not require human judgements for training. Our single model (trained in 39 languages) outperforms or statistically ties with all prior metrics on the WMT 2019 segment-level shared metrics task in all languages (excluding Gujarati where the model had no training data). We also explore using our model for the task of quality estimation as a metric-conditioning on the source instead of the reference-and find that it significantly outperforms every submission to the WMT 2019 shared task on quality estimation in every language pair.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Why Skip If You Can Combine: A Simple Knowledge Distillation Technique for Intermediate Layers,"With the growth of computing power neural machine translation (NMT) models also grow accordingly and become better. However, they also become harder to deploy on edge devices due to memory constraints. To cope with this problem, a common practice is to distill knowledge from a large and accurately-trained teacher network (T ) into a compact student network (S). Although knowledge distillation (KD) is useful in most cases, our study shows that existing KD techniques might not be suitable enough for deep NMT engines, so we propose a novel alternative. In our model, besides matching T and S predictions we have a combinatorial mechanism to inject layer-level supervision from T to S. In this paper, we target low-resource settings and evaluate our translation engines for Portuguese→English, Turkish→English, and English→German directions. Students trained using our technique have 50% fewer parameters and can still deliver comparable results to those of 12-layer teachers.","{'sequence': 'With the growth of computing power neural machine translation (NMT) models also grow accordingly and become better.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Statistical Power and Translationese in Machine Translation Evaluation,"The term translationese has been used to describe features of translated text, and in this paper, we provide detailed analysis of potential adverse effects of translationese on machine translation evaluation. Our analysis shows differences in conclusions drawn from evaluations that include translationese in test data compared to experiments that tested only with text originally composed in that language. For this reason we recommend that reverse-created test data be omitted from future machine translation test sets. In addition, we provide a reevaluation of a past machine translation evaluation claiming human-parity of MT. One important issue not previously considered is statistical power of significance tests applied to comparison of human and machine translation. Since the very aim of past evaluations was the investigation of ties between human and MT systems, power analysis is of particular importance, to avoid, for example, claims of human parity simply corresponding to Type II error resulting from the application of a low powered test. We provide detailed analysis of tests used in such evaluations to provide an indication of a suitable minimum sample size for future studies.","{'sequence': 'The term translationese has been used to describe features of translated text, and in this paper, we provide detailed analysis of potential adverse effects of translationese on machine translation evaluation.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Identifying Elements Essential for BERT's Multilinguality,"It has been shown that multilingual BERT (mBERT) yields high quality multilingual representations and enables effective zero-shot transfer. This is surprising given that mBERT does not use any crosslingual signal during training. While recent literature has studied this phenomenon, the reasons for the multilinguality are still somewhat obscure. We aim to identify architectural properties of BERT and linguistic properties of languages that are necessary for BERT to become multilingual. To allow for fast experimentation we propose an efficient setup with small BERT models trained on a mix of synthetic and natural data. Overall, we identify four architectural and two linguistic elements that influence multilinguality. Based on our insights, we experiment with a multilingual pretraining setup that modifies the masking strategy using VecMap, i.e., unsupervised embedding alignment. Experiments on XNLI with three languages indicate that our findings transfer from our small setup to larger scale settings. 0 original .70 1.00 .00 .16 .02 .88 .02 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .79 .03 9 00.2 217 07.8 1 lang-pos .30 .87 .05 .33 .13 .40 .09 .89 .05 .39 .15 .09 .05 9 00.1 216 09.0 2 shift-special .66 1.00 .00 .15 .02 .88 .01 1.00 .00 .97 .02 .63 .13 9 00.1 227 17.9 4 no-random .68 1.00 .00 .19 .03 .87 .02 1.00 .00 .85 .07 .82 .04 9 00.6 273 07.7 5 lang-pos;shift-special .20 .62 .19 .22 .19 .27 .20 .72 .22 .27 .21 .05 .04 10 00.5 205 07.6 6 lang-pos;no-random .30 .91 .04 .29 .10 .36 .12 .89 .05 .32 .15 .25 .12 10 00.4 271 08.6 7 shift-special;no-random .68 1.00 .00 .21 .03 .85 .01 1.00 .00 .89 .06 .79 .04 8 00.3 259 15.6 8 lang-pos;shift-special;no-random .12 .46 .26 .09 .09 .18 .22 .54 .31 .11 .11 .11 .13 10 00.6 254 15.9 15 overparam .58 1.00 .00 .27 .03 .63 .05 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .47 .06 2 00.1 261 04.5 16 lang-pos;overparam .01 .25 .10 .01 .00 .01 .00 .37 .13 .01 .00 .00 .00 3 00.0 254 04.9 17 lang-pos;shift-special;no-random;overparam .00 .05 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .05 .04 .00 .00 .00 .00 1 00.0 307 07.7 3 inv-order .01 .02 .00 .00 .00 .01 .00 .02 .00 .01 .01 .00 .00 11 00.3 209 14.4 9 lang-pos;inv-order;shift-special;no-random .00 .04 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 .03 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 10 00.4 270 20.1 18 untrained .00 .97 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 .96 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 3484 44.1 4128 42.7 19 untrained;lang-pos .00 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 3488 41.4 4133 50.3 30 knn-replace .74 1.00 .00 .31 .08 .88 .00 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .81 .01 11 00.3 225 12.4","{'sequence': 'It has been shown that multilingual BERT (mBERT) yields high quality multilingual representations and enables effective zero-shot transfer.

Experiments on XNLI with three languages indicate that our findings transfer from our small setup to larger scale settings. 0 original .70 1.00 .00 .16 .02 .88 .02 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .79 .03 9 00.2 217 07.8 1 lang-pos .30 .87 .05 .33 .13 .40 .09 .89 .05 .39 .15 .09 .05 9 00.1 216 09.0 2 shift-special .66 1.00 .00 .15 .02 .88 .01 1.00 .00 .97 .02 .63 .13 9 00.1 227 17.9 4 no-random .68 1.00 .00 .19 .03 .87 .02 1.00 .00 .85 .07 .82 .04 9 00.6 273 07.7 5 lang-pos;shift-special .20 .62 .19 .22 .19 .27 .20 .72 .22 .27 .21 .05 .04 10 00.5 205 07.6 6 lang-pos;no-random .30 .91 .04 .29 .10 .36 .12 .89 .05 .32 .15 .25 .12 10 00.4 271 08.6 7 shift-special;no-random .68 1.00 .00 .21 .03 .85 .01 1.00 .00 .89 .06 .79 .04 8 00.3 259 15.6 8 lang-pos;shift-special;no-random .12 .46 .26 .09 .09 .18 .22 .54 .31 .11 .11 .11 .13 10 00.6 254 15.9 15 overparam .58 1.00 .00 .27 .03 .63 .05 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .47 .06 2 00.1 261 04.5 16 lang-pos;overparam .01 .25 .10 .01 .00 .01 .00 .37 .13 .01 .00 .00 .00 3 00.0 254 04.9 17 lang-pos;shift-special;no-random;overparam .00 .05 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .05 .04 .00 .00 .00 .00 1 00.0 307 07.7 3 inv-order .01 .02 .00 .00 .00 .01 .00 .02 .00 .01 .01 .00 .00 11 00.3 209 14.4 9 lang-pos;inv-order;shift-special;no-random .00 .04 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 .03 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 10 00.4 270 20.1 18 untrained .00 .97 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 .96 .01 .00 .00 .00 .00 3484 44.1 4128 42.7 19 untrained;lang-pos .00 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 .02 .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 3488 41.4 4133 50.3 30 knn-replace .74 1.00 .00 .31 .08 .88 .00 1.00 .00 .97 .01 .81 .01 11 00.3 225 12.4', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Question Answering', 'Summarization', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07718102633953094, 0.07511848211288452, 0.075005903840065, 0.06993132084608078, 0.05947304517030716, 0.05878724157810211, 0.054824043065309525, 0.04738520830869675, 0.047311585396528244, 0.04461110010743141, 0.04401608183979988, 0.037573277950286865, 0.03574945032596588, 0.03457571938633919, 0.034104544669389725, 0.029991017654538155, 0.029295139014720917, 0.029057325795292854, 0.026815520599484444, 0.025738263502717018, 0.02570035308599472, 0.024058829993009567, 0.013695633970201015]}",0.07718102633953094,Speech and Multimodality,0.07511848211288452
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,CCAligned: A Massive Collection of Cross-Lingual Web-Document Pairs,"Cross-lingual document alignment aims to identify pairs of documents in two distinct languages that are of comparable content or translations of each other.

In addition to curating this massive dataset, we introduce baseline methods that leverage crosslingual representations to identify aligned documents based on their textual content.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Bridging Linguistic Typology and Multilingual Machine Translation with Multi-View Language Representations,"Sparse language vectors from linguistic typology databases and learned embeddings from tasks like multilingual machine translation have been investigated in isolation, without analysing how they could benefit from each other's language characterisation. We propose to fuse both views using singular vector canonical correlation analysis and study what kind of information is induced from each source. By inferring typological features and language phylogenies, we observe that our representations embed typology and strengthen correlations with language relationships. We then take advantage of our multi-view language vector space for multilingual machine translation, where we achieve competitive overall translation accuracy in tasks that require information about language similarities, such as language clustering and ranking candidates for multilingual transfer. With our method, which is also released as a tool, we can easily project and assess new languages without expensive retraining of massive multilingual or ranking models, which are major disadvantages of related approaches.","{'sequence': ""Sparse language vectors from linguistic typology databases and learned embeddings from tasks like multilingual machine translation have been investigated in isolation, without analysing how they could benefit from each other's language characterisation.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,MAD-X: An Adapter-Based Framework for Multi-Task Cross-Lingual Transfer,"The main goal behind state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual models such as multilingual BERT and XLM-R is enabling and bootstrapping NLP applications in low-resource languages through zero-shot or few-shot crosslingual transfer. However, due to limited model capacity, their transfer performance is the weakest exactly on such low-resource languages and languages unseen during pretraining. We propose MAD-X, an adapter-based framework that enables high portability and parameter-efficient transfer to arbitrary tasks and languages by learning modular language and task representations. In addition, we introduce a novel invertible adapter architecture and a strong baseline method for adapting a pretrained multilingual model to a new language. MAD-X outperforms the state of the art in cross-lingual transfer across a representative set of typologically diverse languages on named entity recognition and causal commonsense reasoning, and achieves competitive results on question answering.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,An Empirical Study of Generation Order for Machine Translation,"In this work, we present an empirical study of generation order for machine translation. Building on recent advances in insertion-based modeling, we first introduce a soft orderreward framework that enables us to train models to follow arbitrary oracle generation policies. We then make use of this framework to explore a large variety of generation orders, including uninformed orders, locationbased orders, frequency-based orders, contentbased orders, and model-based orders. Curiously, we find that for the WMT'14 English → German and WMT'18 English → Chinese translation tasks, order does not have a substantial impact on output quality. Moreover, for English → German, we even discover that unintuitive orderings such as alphabetical and shortest-first can match the performance of a standard Transformer, suggesting that traditional left-to-right generation may not be necessary to achieve high performance.","{'sequence': ""In this work, we present an empirical study of generation order for machine translation.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,"Not Low-Resource Anymore: Aligner Ensembling, Batch Filtering, and New Datasets for Bengali-English Machine Translation","Despite being the seventh most widely spoken language in the world, Bengali has received much less attention in machine translation literature due to being low in resources. Most publicly available parallel corpora for Bengali are not large enough; and have rather poor quality, mostly because of incorrect sentence alignments resulting from erroneous sentence segmentation, and also because of a high volume of noise present in them. In this work, we build a customized sentence segmenter for Bengali and propose two novel methods for parallel corpus creation on low-resource setups: aligner ensembling and batch filtering. With the segmenter and the two methods combined, we compile a high-quality Bengali-English parallel corpus comprising of 2.75 million sentence pairs, more than 2 million of which were not available before. Training on neural models, we achieve an improvement of more than 9 BLEU score over previous approaches to Bengali-English machine translation. We also evaluate on a new test set of 1000 pairs made with extensive quality control. We release the segmenter, parallel corpus, and the evaluation set, thus elevating Bengali from its low-resource status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever large scale study on Bengali-English machine translation. We believe our study will pave the way for future research on Bengali-English machine translation as well as other low-resource languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Translation Artifacts in Cross-lingual Transfer Learning,"Both human and machine translation play a central role in cross-lingual transfer learning: many multilingual datasets have been created through professional translation services, and using machine translation to translate either the test set or the training set is a widely used transfer technique. In this paper, we show that such translation process can introduce subtle artifacts that have a notable impact in existing cross-lingual models. For instance, in natural language inference, translating the premise and the hypothesis independently can reduce the lexical overlap between them, which current models are highly sensitive to. We show that some previous findings in cross-lingual transfer learning need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Multi-Unit Transformers for Neural Machine Translation,"Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) achieve remarkable success in Neural Machine Translation. Many efforts have been devoted to deepening the Transformer by stacking several units (i.e., a combination of Multihead Attentions and FFN) in a cascade, while the investigation over multiple parallel units draws little attention. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Unit TransformErs (MUTE), which aim to promote the expressiveness of the Transformer by introducing diverse and complementary units. Specifically, we use several parallel units and show that modeling with multiple units improves model performance and introduces diversity. Further, to better leverage the advantage of the multi-unit setting, we design biased module and sequential dependency that guide and encourage complementariness among different units. Experimental results on three machine translation tasks, the NIST Chinese-to-English, WMT'14 English-to-German and WMT'18 Chinese-to-English, show that the MUTE models significantly outperform the Transformer-Base, by up to +1.52, +1.90 and +1.10 BLEU points, with only a mild drop in inference speed (about 3.1%). In addition, our methods also surpass the Transformer-Big model, with only 54% of its parameters. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MUTE, as well as its efficiency in both the inference process and parameter usage. 1","{'sequence': ""Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) achieve remarkable success in Neural Machine Translation.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Revisiting Modularized Multilingual NMT to Meet Industrial Demands,"The complete sharing of parameters for multilingual translation (1-1) has been the mainstream approach in current research. However, degraded performance due to the capacity bottleneck and low maintainability hinders its extensive adoption in industries. In this study, we revisit the multilingual neural machine translation model that only share modules among the same languages (M2) as a practical alternative to 1-1 to satisfy industrial requirements. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify the benefits of multi-way training and demonstrate that the M2 can enjoy these benefits without suffering from the capacity bottleneck. Furthermore, the interlingual space of the M2 allows convenient modification of the model. By leveraging trained modules, we find that incrementally added modules exhibit better performance than singly trained models. The zero-shot performance of the added modules is even comparable to supervised models. Our findings suggest that the M2 can be a competent candidate for multilingual translation in industries.","{'sequence': 'The complete sharing of parameters for multilingual translation (1-1) has been the mainstream approach in current research.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Token-level Adaptive Training for Neural Machine Translation,"There exists a token imbalance phenomenon in natural language as different tokens appear with different frequencies, which leads to different learning difficulties for tokens in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The vanilla NMT model usually adopts trivial equal-weighted objectives for target tokens with different frequencies and tends to generate more high-frequency tokens and less lowfrequency tokens compared with the golden token distribution. However, low-frequency tokens may carry critical semantic information that will affect the translation quality once they are neglected. In this paper, we explored target token-level adaptive objectives based on token frequencies to assign appropriate weights for each target token during training. We aimed that those meaningful but relatively low-frequency words could be assigned with larger weights in objectives to encourage the model to pay more attention to these tokens. Our method yields consistent improvements in translation quality on ZH-EN, EN-RO, and EN-DE translation tasks, especially on sentences that contain more low-frequency tokens where we can get 1.68, 1.02, and 0.52 BLEU increases compared with baseline, respectively. Further analyses show that our method can also improve the lexical diversity of translation.","{'sequence': 'There exists a token imbalance phenomenon in natural language as different tokens appear with different frequencies, which leads to different learning difficulties for tokens in Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

This level of alignment is important for the practical task of cross-lingual information retrieval. Building on multilingual BERT (mBERT), we study different strategies for achieving strong alignment. We find that augmenting training data via machine translation is effective, and improves significantly over using mBERT outof-the-box. Interestingly, model performance on zero-shot variants of our task that only target ""weak"" alignment is not predictive of performance on LAReQA. This finding underscores our claim that language-agnostic retrieval is a substantively new kind of crosslingual evaluation, and suggests that measuring both weak and strong alignment will be important for improving cross-lingual systems going forward.

Our method yields higher correlation with human judgment not only for the submissions of WMT 2019 English→German, but also for Back-translation and APE augmented MT output, which have been shown to have low correlation with automatic metrics using standard references.

Specifically, for each target decoding position, instead of only one token, we predict a short sequence of tokens in an autoregressive way. We further design an efficient merging algorithm to align and merge the output pieces into one final output sequence. We integrate LAT into the conditional masked language model (CMLM; Ghazvininejad et al., 2019) and similarly adopt iterative decoding. Empirical results on five translation tasks show that compared with CMLM, our method achieves comparable or better performance with fewer decoding iterations, bringing a 2.5x speedup.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Long-Short Term Masking Transformer: A Simple but Effective Baseline for Document-level Neural Machine Translation,"Many document-level neural machine translation (NMT) systems have explored the utility of context-aware architecture, usually requiring an increasing number of parameters and computational complexity. However, few attention is paid to the baseline model. In this paper, we research extensively the pros and cons of the standard transformer in document-level translation, and find that the auto-regressive property can simultaneously bring both the advantage of the consistency and the disadvantage of error accumulation. Therefore, we propose a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors.

Therefore, we propose a surprisingly simple long-short term masking self-attention on top of the standard transformer to both effectively capture the long-range dependence and reduce the propagation of errors.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamic Data Selection and Weighting for Iterative Back-Translation,"Back-translation has proven to be an effective method to utilize monolingual data in neural machine translation (NMT), and iteratively conducting back-translation can further improve the model performance. Selecting which monolingual data to back-translate is crucial, as we require that the resulting synthetic data are of high quality and reflect the target domain. To achieve these two goals, data selection and weighting strategies have been proposed, with a common practice being to select samples close to the target domain but also dissimilar to the average general-domain text. In this paper, we provide insights into this commonly used approach and generalize it to a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, which is applied to iterative back-translation models. In addition, we propose weighting strategies based on both the current quality of the sentence and its improvement over the previous iteration. We evaluate our models on domain adaptation, low-resource, and high-resource MT settings and on two language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve improvements of up to 1.8 BLEU points over competitive baselines. 1","{'sequence': 'Back-translation has proven to be an effective method to utilize monolingual data in neural machine translation (NMT), and iteratively conducting back-translation can further improve the model performance.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Pre-tokenization of Multi-word Expressions in Cross-lingual Word Embeddings,"Cross-lingual word embedding (CWE) algorithms represent words in multiple languages in a unified vector space. Multi-Word Expressions (MWE) are common in every language. When training word embeddings, each component word of an MWE gets its own separate embedding, and thus, MWEs are not translated by CWEs. We propose a simple method for word translation of MWEs to and from English in ten languages: we first compile lists of MWEs in each language and then tokenize the MWEs as single tokens before training word embeddings. CWEs are trained on a wordtranslation task using the dictionaries that only contain single words. In order to evaluate MWE translation, we created bilingual word lists from multilingual WordNet that include single-token words and MWEs, and most importantly, include MWEs that correspond to single words in another language. We show that the pre-tokenization of MWEs as single tokens performs better than averaging the embeddings of the individual tokens of the MWE. We can translate MWEs at a top-10 precision of 30-60%. The tokenization of MWEs makes the occurrences of single words in a training corpus more sparse, but we show that it does not pose negative impacts on single-word translations.","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual word embedding (CWE) algorithms represent words in multiple languages in a unified vector space.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Direct Segmentation Models for Streaming Speech Translation,"The cascade approach to Speech Translation (ST) is based on a pipeline that concatenates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system followed by a Machine Translation (MT) system. These systems are usually connected by a segmenter that splits the ASR output into, hopefully, semantically self-contained chunks to be fed into the MT system. This is specially challenging in the case of streaming ST, where latency requirements must also be taken into account. This work proposes novel segmentation models for streaming ST that incorporate not only textual, but also acoustic information to decide when the ASR output is split into a chunk. An extensive and thorough experimental setup is carried out on the Europarl-ST dataset to prove the contribution of acoustic information to the performance of the segmentation model in terms of BLEU score in a streaming ST scenario. Finally, comparative results with previous work also show the superiority of the segmentation models proposed in this work.","{'sequence': 'The cascade approach to Speech Translation (ST) is based on a pipeline that concatenates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system followed by a Machine Translation (MT) system.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Language Model Prior for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,"The scarcity of large parallel corpora is an important obstacle for neural machine translation. A common solution is to exploit the knowledge of language models (LM) trained on abundant monolingual data. In this work, we propose a novel approach to incorporate a LM as prior in a neural translation model (TM). Specifically, we add a regularization term, which pushes the output distributions of the TM to be probable under the LM prior, while avoiding wrong predictions when the TM ""disagrees"" with the LM. This objective relates to knowledge distillation, where the LM can be viewed as teaching the TM about the target language. The proposed approach does not compromise decoding speed, because the LM is used only at training time, unlike previous work that requires it during inference. We present an analysis on the effects that different methods have on the distributions of the TM.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Understanding the Difficulty of Training Transformers,"Transformers have proved effective in many NLP tasks.

Our analysis reveals that unbalanced gradients are not the root cause of the instability of training. Instead, we identify an amplification effect that influences training substantially-for each layer in a multi-layer Transformer model, heavy dependency on its residual branch makes training unstable, since it amplifies small parameter perturbations (e.g., parameter updates) and results in significant disturbances in the model output. Yet we observe that a light dependency limits the model potential and leads to inferior trained models.

We hypothesize that statistics of the spectrum of each monolingual embedding space indicate how well they can be aligned. We then introduce several isomorphism measures between two embedding spaces, based on the relevant statistics of their individual spectra. We empirically show that 1) language similarity scores derived from such spectral isomorphism measures are strongly associated with performance observed in different crosslingual tasks, and 2) our spectral-based measures consistently outperform previous standard isomorphism measures, while being computationally more tractable and easier to interpret.

Finally, our measures capture complementary information to typologically driven language distance measures, and the combination of measures from the two families yields even higher task performance correlations. 1 X is mean-centered, column means have been subtracted and are equal to zero.', 'labels': ['Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08936148136854172, 0.05950909107923508, 0.05796068534255028, 0.05766860395669937, 0.05725736916065216, 0.05332653969526291, 0.05116266757249832, 0.04954149201512337, 0.0483243502676487, 0.04549182206392288, 0.044450543820858, 0.043852079659700394, 0.04298029839992523, 0.0415520966053009, 0.03876674547791481, 0.034375082701444626, 0.03295004367828369, 0.029944345355033875, 0.027878476306796074, 0.024992024526000023, 0.024952728301286697, 0.022879617288708687, 0.020821787416934967]}",0.08936148136854172,Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,0.0415520966053009

NLP Applications,Form2Seq : A Framework for Higher-Order Form Structure Extraction,"Document structure extraction has been a widely researched area for decades with recent works performing it as a semantic segmentation task over document images using fullyconvolution networks. Such methods are limited by image resolution due to which they fail to disambiguate structures in dense regions which appear commonly in forms. To mitigate this, we propose Form2Seq, a novel sequenceto-sequence (Seq2Seq) inspired framework for structure extraction using text, with a specific focus on forms, which leverages relative spatial arrangement of structures. We discuss two tasks; 1) Classification of low-level constituent elements (TextBlock and empty fillable Widget) into ten types such as field captions, list items, and others; 2) Grouping lower-level elements into higher-order constructs, such as Text Fields, ChoiceFields and ChoiceGroups, used as information collection mechanism in forms. To achieve this, we arrange the constituent elements linearly in natural reading order, feed their spatial and textual representations to Seq2Seq framework, which sequentially outputs prediction of each element depending on the final task. We modify Seq2Seq for grouping task and discuss improvements obtained through cascaded end-to-end training of two tasks versus training in isolation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our text-based approach achieving an accuracy of 90% on classification task and an F1 of 75.82, 86.01, 61.63 on groups discussed above respectively, outperforming segmentation baselines.

NLP Applications,An Empirical Study on Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero-Shot Labels,"Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges. First, not all labels are well represented in the training set, due to the very large label set and the skewed label distributions of LMTC datasets. Also, label hierarchies and differences in human labelling guidelines may affect graph-aware annotation proximity. Finally, the label hierarchies are periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning, although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art method which combines BERT with LWAN. Finally, we propose new models that leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.","{'sequence': 'Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges.

NLP Applications,Generating Radiology Reports via Memory-driven Transformer,"Medical imaging is frequently used in clinical practice and trials for diagnosis and treatment. Writing imaging reports is time-consuming and can be error-prone for inexperienced radiologists. Therefore, automatically generating radiology reports is highly desired to lighten the workload of radiologists and accordingly promote clinical automation, which is an essential task to apply artificial intelligence to the medical domain. In this paper, we propose to generate radiology reports with memorydriven Transformer, where a relational memory is designed to record key information of the generation process and a memory-driven conditional layer normalization is applied to incorporating the memory into the decoder of Transformer. Experimental results on two prevailing radiology report datasets, IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR, show that our proposed approach outperforms previous models with respect to both language generation metrics and clinical evaluations. Particularly, this is the first work reporting the generation results on MIMIC-CXR to the best of our knowledge. Further analyses also demonstrate that our approach is able to generate long reports with necessary medical terms as well as meaningful image-text attention mappings. 1","{'sequence': 'Medical imaging is frequently used in clinical practice and trials for diagnosis and treatment.

NLP Applications,An Empirical Investigation of Contextualized Number Prediction,"We conduct a large scale empirical investigation of contextualized number prediction in running text. Specifically, we consider two tasks: (1) masked number prediction -predicting a missing numerical value within a sentence, and (2) numerical anomaly detectiondetecting an errorful numeric value within a sentence. We experiment with novel combinations of contextual encoders and output distributions over the real number line. Specifically, we introduce a suite of output distribution parameterizations that incorporate latent variables to add expressivity and better fit the natural distribution of numeric values in running text, and combine them with both recurrent and transformer-based encoder architectures. We evaluate these models on two numeric datasets in the financial and scientific domain. Our findings show that output distributions that incorporate discrete latent variables and allow for multiple modes outperform simple flow-based counterparts on all datasets, yielding more accurate numerical prediction and anomaly detection. We also show that our models effectively utilize textual context and benefit from general-purpose unsupervised pretraining. 1","{'sequence': 'We conduct a large scale empirical investigation of contextualized number prediction in running text.

NLP Applications,Predicting Clinical Trial Results by Implicit Evidence Integration,"Clinical trials provide essential guidance for practicing Evidence-Based Medicine, though often accompanying with unendurable costs and risks. To optimize the design of clinical trials, we introduce a novel Clinical Trial Result Prediction (CTRP) task. In the CTRP framework, a model takes a PICO-formatted clinical trial proposal with its background as input and predicts the result, i.e. how the Intervention group compares with the Comparison group in terms of the measured Outcome in the studied Population. While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically, we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets. Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7% relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1.

NLP Applications,Joint Estimation and Analysis of Risk Behavior Ratings in Movie Scripts,"Exposure to violent, sexual, or substanceabuse content in media increases the willingness of children and adolescents to imitate similar behaviors.

To address this limitation, we propose a model that estimates content ratings based on the language use in movie scripts, making our solution available at the earlier stages of creative production. Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art by adapting novel techniques to learn better movie representations from the semantic and sentiment aspects of a character's language use, and by leveraging the co-occurrence of risk behaviors, following a multi-task approach.

We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex.

Human evaluation also proves that our model is able to generate relevant and informative questions. 1', 'labels': ['Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.16461315751075745, 0.08536098152399063, 0.07673879712820053, 0.07154437899589539, 0.06663625687360764, 0.05764946714043617, 0.04313312843441963, 0.040199004113674164, 0.03858783468604088, 0.03646988794207573, 0.032830603420734406, 0.03247231990098953, 0.03184352442622185, 0.028189927339553833, 0.028053104877471924, 0.02707219123840332, 0.026671795174479485, 0.02424362674355507, 0.020737294107675552, 0.019922476261854172, 0.017044950276613235, 0.01681486889719963, 0.013170355930924416]}",0.16461315751075745,Generation,0.03184352442622185
NLP Applications,Methods for Numeracy-Preserving Word Embeddings,"Word embedding models are typically able to capture the semantics of words via the distributional hypothesis, but fail to capture the numerical properties of numbers that appear in a text. This leads to problems with numerical reasoning involving tasks such as question answering. We propose a new methodology to assign and learn embeddings for numbers. Our approach creates Deterministic, Independentof-Corpus Embeddings (referred to as DICE) for numbers, such that their cosine similarity reflects the actual distance on the number line. DICE outperforms a wide range of pre-trained word embedding models across multiple examples of two tasks: (i) evaluating the ability to capture numeration and magnitude; and (ii) to perform list maximum, decoding, and addition. We further explore the utility of these embeddings in downstream applications by initializing numbers with our approach for the task of magnitude prediction. We also introduce a regularization approach to learn model-based embeddings of numbers in a contextual setting.","{'sequence': 'Word embedding models are typically able to capture the semantics of words via the distributional hypothesis, but fail to capture the numerical properties of numbers that appear in a text.

NLP Applications,Selection and Generation: Learning towards Multi-Product Advertisement Post Generation,"As the E-commerce thrives, high-quality online advertising copywriting has attracted more and more attention. Different from the advertising copywriting for a single product, an advertisement (AD) post includes an attractive topic that meets the customer needs and description copywriting about several products under its topic. A good AD post can highlight the characteristics of each product, thus helps customers make a good choice among candidate products. Hence, multi-product AD post generation is meaningful and important. We propose a novel end-to-end model named S-MG Net to generate the AD post. Targeted at such a challenging real-world problem, we split the AD post generation task into two subprocesses: (1) select a set of products via the SelectNet (Selection Network). ( 2 ) generate a post including selected products via the MGenNet (Multi-Generator Network). Concretely, SelectNet first captures the post topic and the relationship among the products to output the representative products. Then, MGen-Net generates the description copywriting of each product. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world AD post dataset demonstrate that our proposed model achieves impressive performance in terms of both automatic metrics as well as human evaluations.","{'sequence': 'As the E-commerce thrives, high-quality online advertising copywriting has attracted more and more attention.

NLP Applications,Generating Fact Checking Briefs,"Fact checking at scale is difficult-while the number of active fact checking websites is growing, it remains too small for the needs of the contemporary media ecosystem. However, despite good intentions, contributions from volunteers are often error-prone, and thus in practice restricted to claim detection. We investigate how to increase the accuracy and efficiency of fact checking by providing information about the claim before performing the check, in the form of natural language briefs. We investigate passage-based briefs, containing a relevant passage from Wikipedia, entitycentric ones consisting of Wikipedia pages of mentioned entities, and Question-Answering Briefs, with questions decomposing the claim, and their answers. To produce QABriefs, we develop QABRIEFER, a model that generates a set of questions conditioned on the claim, searches the web for evidence, and generates answers. To train its components, we introduce QABRIEFDATASET which we collected via crowdsourcing. We show that fact checking with briefs -in particular QABriefs -increases the accuracy of crowdworkers by 10% while slightly decreasing the time taken. For volunteer (unpaid) fact checkers, QABriefs slightly increase accuracy and reduce the time required by around 20%.","{'sequence': 'Fact checking at scale is difficult-while the number of active fact checking websites is growing, it remains too small for the needs of the contemporary media ecosystem.

NLP Applications,Multi-Dimensional Gender Bias Classification,"Machine learning models are trained to find patterns in data. NLP models can inadvertently learn socially undesirable patterns when training on gender biased text. In this work, we propose a novel, general framework that decomposes gender bias in text along several pragmatic and semantic dimensions: bias from the gender of the person being spoken about, bias from the gender of the person being spoken to, and bias from the gender of the speaker. Using this fine-grained framework, we automatically annotate eight large scale datasets with gender information. In addition, we collect a new, crowdsourced evaluation benchmark. Distinguishing between gender bias along multiple dimensions enables us to train better and more fine-grained gender bias classifiers.

NLP Applications,Utility is in the Eye of the User: A Critique of NLP Leaderboards,"Benchmarks such as GLUE have helped drive advances in NLP by incentivizing the creation of more accurate models. While this leaderboard paradigm has been remarkably successful, a historical focus on performance-based evaluation has been at the expense of other qualities that the NLP community values in models, such as compactness, fairness, and energy efficiency. In this opinion paper, we study the divergence between what is incentivized by leaderboards and what is useful in practice through the lens of microeconomic theory. We frame both the leaderboard and NLP practitioners as consumers and the benefit they get from a model as its utility to them. With this framing, we formalize how leaderboards -in their current form -can be poor proxies for the NLP community at large. For example, a highly inefficient model would provide less utility to practitioners but not to a leaderboard, since it is a cost that only the former must bear. To allow practitioners to better estimate a model's utility to them, we advocate for more transparency on leaderboards, such as the reporting of statistics that are of practical concern (e.g., model size, energy efficiency, and inference latency).","{'sequence': ""Benchmarks such as GLUE have helped drive advances in NLP by incentivizing the creation of more accurate models.

To allow practitioners to better estimate a model's utility to them, we advocate for more transparency on leaderboards, such as the reporting of statistics that are of practical concern (e.g., model size, energy efficiency, and inference latency)."", 'labels': ['Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Generation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Extraction', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality'], 'scores': [0.1025923565030098, 0.07527726143598557, 0.06466225534677505, 0.06373751908540726, 0.0614999383687973, 0.056647662073373795, 0.05467411130666733, 0.05428702384233475, 0.051571980118751526, 0.050315774977207184, 0.04647231101989746, 0.0424765907227993, 0.032533202320337296, 0.03240980952978134, 0.029270049184560776, 0.02554832398891449, 0.025416668504476547, 0.025308556854724884, 0.02313757687807083, 0.0230465829372406, 0.022238701581954956, 0.018786976113915443, 0.01808883622288704]}",0.1025923565030098,"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",0.032533202320337296
NLP Applications,Transfer Learning and Distant Supervision for Multilingual Transformer Models: A Study on African Languages,"Multilingual transformer models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa have obtained great improvements for many NLP tasks on a variety of languages. However, recent works also showed that results from high-resource languages could not be easily transferred to realistic, low-resource scenarios. In this work, we study trends in performance for different amounts of available resources for the three African languages Hausa, isiXhosa and Yorùbá on both NER and topic classification. We show that in combination with transfer learning or distant supervision, these models can achieve with as little as 10 or 100 labeled sentences the same performance as baselines with much more supervised training data. However, we also find settings where this does not hold. Our discussions and additional experiments on assumptions such as time and hardware restrictions highlight challenges and opportunities in low-resource learning.","{'sequence': 'Multilingual transformer models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa have obtained great improvements for many NLP tasks on a variety of languages.

NLP Applications,Natural Language Processing for Achieving Sustainable Development: the Case of Neural Labelling to Enhance Community Profiling,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence -and especially Machine Learningto the field of Sustainable Development (SD).

In particular, we focus on the case of community profiling in developing countries, where, in contrast to the developed world, a notable data gap exists. Here, NLP could help to address the cost and time barrier of structuring qualitative data that prohibits its widespread use and associated benefits. We propose the new extreme multi-class multi-label Automatic User-Perceived Value classification task. We release Stories2Insights (S2I), an expertannotated dataset of interviews carried out in Uganda, we provide a detailed corpus analysis, and we implement a number of strong neural baselines to address the task.

We also demonstrate that considering a broad selection of source domains is crucial for obtaining the best zero-shot transfer performances, which contrasts the standard procedure that merely relies on the largest and most similar domains. In addition, we extensively study how to best combine multiple source domains. We propose to incorporate self-supervised with supervised multi-task learning on all available source domains. Our best zero-shot transfer model considerably outperforms in-domain BERT and the previous state of the art on six benchmarks.

Further, free-text medical notes may contain information not immediately available in structured variables.

This manual designation is an onerous task because it necessitates profound knowledge about encyclopedic language, as well navigating circuitous set of wiki guidelines. In this paper we propose Neural wikipedia Quality Monitor (NwQM), a novel deep learning model which accumulates signals from several key information sources such as article text, meta data and images to obtain improved Wikipedia article representation. We present comparison of our approach against a plethora of available solutions and show 8% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches with detailed ablation studies.","{'sequence': 'Millions of people irrespective of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds, depend on Wikipedia articles everyday for keeping themselves informed regarding popular as well as obscure topics.

NLP Applications,Multi-resolution Annotations for Emoji Prediction,"Emojis are able to express various linguistic components, including emotions, sentiments, events, etc. Predicting the proper emojis associated with text provides a way to summarize the text accurately, and it has been proven to be a good auxiliary task to many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Labels in existing emoji prediction datasets are all passage-based and are usually under the multi-class classification setting. However, in many cases, one single emoji cannot fully cover the theme of a piece of text. It is thus useful to infer the part of text related to each emoji. The lack of multi-label and aspectlevel emoji prediction datasets is one of the bottlenecks for this task. This paper annotates an emoji prediction dataset with passage-level multi-class/multi-label, and aspect-level multiclass annotations. We also present a novel annotation method with which we generate the aspect-level annotations. The annotations are generated heuristically, taking advantage of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer networks. We validate the annotations both automatically and manually to ensure their quality. We also benchmark the dataset with a pretrained BERT model.","{'sequence': 'Emojis are able to express various linguistic components, including emotions, sentiments, events, etc. Predicting the proper emojis associated with text provides a way to summarize the text accurately, and it has been proven to be a good auxiliary task to many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.

NLP Applications,Authorship Attribution for Neural Text Generation,"In recent years, the task of generating realistic short and long texts have made tremendous advancements. In particular, several recently proposed neural network-based language models have demonstrated their astonishing capabilities to generate texts that are challenging to distinguish from human-written texts with the naked eye. Despite many benefits and utilities of such neural methods, in some applications, being able to tell the ""author"" of a text in question becomes critically important. In this work, in the context of this Turing Test, we investigate the so-called authorship attribution problem in three versions: (1) given two texts T 1 and T 2 , are both generated by the same method or not? (2) is the given text T written by a human or machine? (3) given a text T and k candidate neural methods, can we single out the method (among k alternatives) that generated T ? Against one humanwritten and eight machine-generated texts (i.e., CTRL, GPT, GPT2, GROVER, XLM, XL-NET, PPLM, FAIR), we empirically experiment with the performance of various models in three problems. By and large, we find that most generators still generate texts significantly different from human-written ones, thereby making three problems easier to solve.

NLP Applications,Wasserstein Distance Regularized Sequence Representation for Text Matching in Asymmetrical Domains,"One approach to matching texts from asymmetrical domains is projecting the input sequences into a common semantic space as feature vectors upon which the matching function can be readily defined and learned. In realworld matching practices, it is often observed that with the training goes on, the feature vectors projected from different domains tend to be indistinguishable. The phenomenon, however, is often overlooked in existing matching models. As a result, the feature vectors are constructed without any regularization, which inevitably increases the difficulty of learning the downstream matching functions. In this paper, we propose a novel match method tailored for text matching in asymmetrical domains, called WD-Match. In WD-Match, a Wasserstein distance-based regularizer is defined to regularize the features vectors projected from different domains. As a result, the method enforces the feature projection function to generate vectors such that those correspond to different domains cannot be easily discriminated. The training process of WD-Match amounts to a game that minimizes the matching loss regularized by the Wasserstein distance. WD-Match can be used to improve different text matching methods, by using the method as its underlying matching model. Four popular text matching methods have been exploited in the paper. Experimental results based on four publicly available benchmarks showed that WD-Match consistently outperformed the underlying methods and the baselines.","{'sequence': 'One approach to matching texts from asymmetrical domains is projecting the input sequences into a common semantic space as feature vectors upon which the matching function can be readily defined and learned.

NLP Applications,HABERTOR: An Efficient and Effective Deep Hatespeech Detector,"We present our HABERTOR model for detecting hatespeech in large scale user-generated content. Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. HABERTOR inherits BERT's architecture, but is different in four aspects: (i) it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset; (ii) it consists of Quaternionbased factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage; (iii) it uses our proposed multisource ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and (iv) it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed finegrained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that HABERTOR works better than 15 state-ofthe-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our HABERTOR is 4∼5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pretrain it by using less than 1% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that HABERTOR transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification.","{'sequence': ""We present our HABERTOR model for detecting hatespeech in large scale user-generated content.

NLP Applications,Assessing the Helpfulness of Learning Materials with Inference-Based Learner-Like Agent,"Many English-as-a-second language learners have trouble using near-synonym words (e.g., small vs. little; briefly vs. shortly) correctly, and often look for example sentences to learn how two nearly synonymous terms differ. Prior work uses hand-crafted scores to recommend sentences but have difficulty in adopting such scores to all the near-synonyms as near-synonyms differ in various ways. We notice that the helpfulness of the learning material would reflect on the learners' performance. Thus, we propose the inference-based learner-like agent to mimic learner behavior and identify good learning materials by examining the agent's performance. To enable the agent to behave like a learner, we leverages entailment modeling's capability of inferring answers from the provided materials. Experimental results show that the proposed agent is equipped with good learner-like behavior to achieve the best performance in both fill-inthe-blank (FITB) and good example sentence selection tasks. We further conduct a classroom user study with college ESL learners. The results of the user study show that the proposed agent can find out example sentences that help students learn more easily and efficiently. Compared to other models, the proposed agent improves the score of more than 17% of students after learning.","{'sequence': ""Many English-as-a-second language learners have trouble using near-synonym words (e.g., small vs. little; briefly vs. shortly) correctly, and often look for example sentences to learn how two nearly synonymous terms differ.

Thus, we propose the inference-based learner-like agent to mimic learner behavior and identify good learning materials by examining the agent's performance. To enable the agent to behave like a learner, we leverages entailment modeling's capability of inferring answers from the provided materials. Experimental results show that the proposed agent is equipped with good learner-like behavior to achieve the best performance in both fill-inthe-blank (FITB) and good example sentence selection tasks. We further conduct a classroom user study with college ESL learners. The results of the user study show that the proposed agent can find out example sentences that help students learn more easily and efficiently. Compared to other models, the proposed agent improves the score of more than 17% of students after learning."", 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Question Answering', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0723191648721695, 0.07053503394126892, 0.06801237165927887, 0.056411150842905045, 0.05200178548693657, 0.048984941095113754, 0.04639153182506561, 0.046188268810510635, 0.04613734409213066, 0.04608182609081268, 0.043516792356967926, 0.04314204305410385, 0.04233953729271889, 0.040513139218091965, 0.04021132364869118, 0.0386534184217453, 0.03648640215396881, 0.03295471519231796, 0.03249582275748253, 0.031283214688301086, 0.028486544266343117, 0.019479241222143173, 0.017374329268932343]}",0.0723191648721695,Speech and Multimodality,0.04608182609081268
NLP Applications,To Schedule or not to Schedule: Extracting Task Specific Temporal Entities and Associated Negation Constraints,"State of the art research for date-time 1 entity extraction from text is task agnostic.

NLP Applications,What time is it? Temporal Analysis of Novels,"Recognizing the flow of time in a story is a crucial aspect of understanding it. Prior work related to time has primarily focused on identifying temporal expressions or relative sequencing of events, but here we propose computationally annotating each line of a book with wall clock times, even in the absence of explicit time-descriptive phrases. To do so, we construct a data set of hourly time phrases from 52,183 fictional books. We then construct a time-of-day classification model that achieves an average error of 2.27 hours. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing a book in whole using dynamic programming of breakpoints, we can roughly partition a book into segments that each correspond to a particular time-of-day. This approach improves upon baselines by over two hour. Finally, we apply our model to a corpus of literature categorized by different periods in history, to show interesting trends of hourly activity throughout the past. Among several observations we find that the fraction of events taking place past 10 P.M jumps past 1880 -coincident with the advent of the electric light bulb and city lights.","{'sequence': 'Recognizing the flow of time in a story is a crucial aspect of understanding it.

We introduce an architecture that achieves a potent blend of chaotic temporal signals from financial data, social media, and inter-stock relationships via a graph neural network in a hierarchical temporal fashion. Through experiments on real-world S&P 500 index data and English tweets, we show the practical applicability of our model as a tool for investment decision making and trading. 1 https://medium.com/scoop-markets/7-tweets-whichwiped-40-billion-off-the-stock-market', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.1431266963481903, 0.08591213822364807, 0.08381727337837219, 0.07256389409303665, 0.06222525238990784, 0.05602342635393143, 0.05332352966070175, 0.04916432127356529, 0.04777732864022255, 0.040037643164396286, 0.03794483840465546, 0.037232305854558945, 0.034510720521211624, 0.03133867308497429, 0.030557781457901, 0.02185768075287342, 0.017735794186592102, 0.017683565616607666, 0.01738813892006874, 0.016763735562562943, 0.01572047732770443, 0.015698373317718506, 0.01159635093063116]}",0.1431266963481903,Speech and Multimodality,0.034510720521211624
NLP Applications,Fact or Fiction: Verifying Scientific Claims,"We introduce scientific claim verification, a new task to select abstracts from the research literature containing evidence that SUP-PORTS or REFUTES a given scientific claim, and to identify rationales justifying each decision.

NLP Applications,An Unsupervised Joint System for Text Generation from Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Parsing,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) can vary greatly from one domain to another. Therefore supervised approaches to both graph-to-text generation and text-to-graph knowledge extraction (semantic parsing) will always suffer from a shortage of domain-specific parallel graphtext data; at the same time, adapting a model trained on a different domain is often impossible due to little or no overlap in entities and relations. This situation calls for an approach that (1) does not need large amounts of annotated data and thus (2) does not need to rely on domain adaptation techniques to work well in different domains. To this end, we present the first approach to unsupervised text generation from KGs and show simultaneously how it can be used for unsupervised semantic parsing. We evaluate our approach on WebNLG v2.1 and a new benchmark leveraging scene graphs from Visual Genome. Our system outperforms strong baselines for both text↔graph conversion tasks without any manual adaptation from one dataset to the other. In additional experiments, we investigate the impact of using different unsupervised objectives. 1","{'sequence': 'Knowledge graphs (KGs) can vary greatly from one domain to another.

NLP Applications,Planning and Generating Natural and Diverse Disfluent Texts as Augmentation for Disfluency Detection,"Existing approaches to disfluency detection heavily depend on human-annotated data.

In this work, we propose a simple Planner-Generator based disfluency generation model to generate natural and diverse disfluent texts as augmented data, where the Planner decides on where to insert disfluent segments and the Generator follows the prediction to generate corresponding disfluent segments. We further utilize this augmented data for pretraining and leverage it for the task of disfluency detection.

NLP Applications,Recurrent Event Network: Autoregressive Structure Inferenceover Temporal Knowledge Graphs,"Knowledge graph reasoning is a critical task in natural language processing. The task becomes more challenging on temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact is associated with a timestamp. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps and they are not able to predict facts happening in the future. This paper proposes Recurrent Event Network (RE-NET), a novel autoregressive architecture for predicting future interactions. The occurrence of a fact (event) is modeled as a probability distribution conditioned on temporal sequences of past knowledge graphs. Specifically, our RE-NET employs a recurrent event encoder to encode past facts, and uses a neighborhood aggregator to model the connection of facts at the same timestamp. Future facts can then be inferred in a sequential manner based on the two modules. We evaluate our proposed method via link prediction at future times on five public datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the strength of RE-NET, especially on multi-step inference over future timestamps, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all five datasets 1 .

NLP Applications,Point to the Expression: Solving Algebraic Word Problems using the Expression-Pointer Transformer Model,"Solving algebraic word problems has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. To solve algebraic word problems, recent studies suggested neural models that generate solution equations by using 'Op (operator/operand)' tokens as a unit of input/output. However, such a neural model suffered two issues: expression fragmentation and operand-context separation. To address each of these two issues, we propose a pure neural model, Expression-Pointer Transformer (EPT), which uses (1) 'Expression' token and (2) operand-context pointers when generating solution equations. The performance of the EPT model is tested on three datasets: ALG514, DRAW-1K, and MAWPS.

(2) The fully automatic EPT model, which does not use hand-crafted features, yields comparable performance to existing models using hand-crafted features, and achieves better performance than existing pure neural models by at most 40%."", 'labels': ['Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Extraction', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07918278872966766, 0.07247508317232132, 0.06816141307353973, 0.06019293889403343, 0.06005806475877762, 0.058316994458436966, 0.056083761155605316, 0.05283575877547264, 0.044567205011844635, 0.04060645028948784, 0.03987480700016022, 0.03824947401881218, 0.037995245307683945, 0.036294497549533844, 0.03551546111702919, 0.03342543542385101, 0.03317943215370178, 0.032842375338077545, 0.030647099018096924, 0.028677761554718018, 0.024170776829123497, 0.0210657250136137, 0.015581385232508183]}",0.07918278872966766,Generation,0.056083761155605316
NLP Applications,MODE-LSTM: A Parameter-efficient Recurrent Network with Multi-Scale for Sentence Classification,"The central problem of sentence classification is to extract multi-scale n-gram features for understanding the semantic meaning of sentences. Most existing models tackle this problem by stacking CNN and RNN models, which easily leads to feature redundancy and overfitting because of relatively limited datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model called Multi-scale Orthogonal inDependEnt LSTM (MODE-LSTM), which not only has effective parameters and good generalization ability, but also considers multiscale n-gram features. We disentangle the hidden state of the LSTM into several independently updated small hidden states and apply an orthogonal constraint on their recurrent matrices. We then equip this structure with sliding windows of different sizes for extracting multi-scale n-gram features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves better or competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on eight benchmark datasets. We also combine our model with BERT to further boost the generalization performance.","{'sequence': 'The central problem of sentence classification is to extract multi-scale n-gram features for understanding the semantic meaning of sentences.

NLP Applications,Towards Medical Machine Reading Comprehension with Structural Knowledge and Plain Text,"Machine reading comprehension (MRC) has achieved significant progress on the open domain in recent years, mainly due to large-scale pre-trained language models. However, it performs much worse in specific domains such as the medical field due to the lack of extensive training data and professional structural knowledge neglect. As an effort, we first collect a large scale medical multi-choice question dataset (more than 21k instances) for the National Licensed Pharmacist Examination in China. It is a challenging medical examination with a passing rate of less than 14.2% in 2018. Then we propose a novel reading comprehension model KMQA, which can fully exploit the structural medical knowledge (i.e., medical knowledge graph) and the reference medical plain text (i.e., text snippets retrieved from reference books).

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",A Joint Multiple Criteria Model in Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Chinese Word Segmentation,"Word-level information is important in natural language processing (NLP), especially for the Chinese language due to its high linguistic complexity. Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is an essential task for Chinese downstream NLP tasks. Existing methods have already achieved a competitive performance for CWS on large-scale annotated corpora. However, the accuracy of the method will drop dramatically when it handles an unsegmented text with lots of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In addition, there are many different segmentation criteria for addressing different requirements of downstream NLP tasks.

We find that, in the low-resource setting, the novel approaches outperform existing ones on all languages by up to 11.4% accuracy. However, while accuracy in emulated low-resource scenarios is over 50% for all languages, for the truly lowresource languages Popoluca and Tepehua, our best model only obtains 37.4% and 28.4% accuracy, respectively. Thus, we conclude that canonical segmentation is still a challenging task for low-resource languages.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Generation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'NLP Applications', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09986796230077744, 0.0871865302324295, 0.08116912841796875, 0.0792064294219017, 0.07902803272008896, 0.07236144691705704, 0.06242123618721962, 0.056311532855033875, 0.03846165910363197, 0.03736534342169762, 0.03669944033026695, 0.032744746655225754, 0.030175810679793358, 0.02464398927986622, 0.024015162140130997, 0.023793386295437813, 0.02211880311369896, 0.021962083876132965, 0.0215079877525568, 0.020308325067162514, 0.019488373771309853, 0.018068406730890274, 0.011094254441559315]}",0.09986796230077744,Question Answering,0.0792064294219017
Question Answering,Learning to Explain: Datasets and Models for Identifying Valid Reasoning Chains in Multihop Question-Answering,"Despite the rapid progress in multihop question-answering (QA), models still have trouble explaining why an answer is correct, with limited explanation training data available to learn from. To address this, we introduce three explanation datasets in which explanations formed from corpus facts are annotated. Our first dataset, eQASC, contains over 98K explanation annotations for the multihop question answering dataset QASC, and is the first that annotates multiple candidate explanations for each answer. The second dataset eQASC-perturbed is constructed by crowd-sourcing perturbations (while preserving their validity) of a subset of explanations in QASC, to test consistency and generalization of explanation prediction models. The third dataset eOBQA is constructed by adding explanation annotations to the OBQA dataset to test generalization of models trained on eQASC. We show that this data can be used to significantly improve explanation quality (+14% absolute F1 over a strong retrieval baseline) using a BERT-based classifier, but still behind the upper bound, offering a new challenge for future research. We also explore a delexicalized chain representation in which repeated noun phrases are replaced by variables, thus turning them into generalized reasoning chains (for example: ""X is a Y"" AND ""Y has Z"" IMPLIES ""X has Z""). We find that generalized chains maintain performance while also being more robust to certain perturbations. 1","{'sequence': 'Despite the rapid progress in multihop question-answering (QA), models still have trouble explaining why an answer is correct, with limited explanation training data available to learn from.

Question Answering,Is Multihop QA in DiRe Condition? Measuring and Reducing Disconnected Reasoning,"Has there been real progress in multi-hop question-answering? Models often exploit dataset artifacts to produce correct answers, without connecting information across multiple supporting facts. This limits our ability to measure true progress and defeats the purpose of building multi-hop QA datasets. We make three contributions towards addressing this. First, we formalize such undesirable behavior as disconnected reasoning across subsets of supporting facts. This allows developing a model-agnostic probe for measuring how much any model can cheat via disconnected reasoning. Second, using a notion of contrastive support sufficiency, we introduce an automatic transformation of existing datasets that reduces the amount of disconnected reasoning. Third, our experiments 1 suggest that there hasn't been much progress in multifact QA in the reading comprehension setting. For a recent large-scale model (XLNet), we show that only 18 points out of its answer F1 score of 72 on HotpotQA are obtained through multifact reasoning, roughly the same as that of a simpler RNN baseline. Our transformation substantially reduces disconnected reasoning (19 points in answer F1). It is complementary to adversarial approaches, yielding further reductions in conjunction.","{'sequence': ""Has there been real progress in multi-hop question-answering?

Question Answering,Context-Aware Answer Extraction in Question Answering,"Extractive QA models have shown very promising performance in predicting the correct answer to a question for a given passage. However, they sometimes result in predicting the correct answer text but in a context irrelevant to the given question. This discrepancy becomes especially important as the number of occurrences of the answer text in a passage increases. To resolve this issue, we propose BLANC (BLock AttentioN for Context prediction) based on two main ideas: context prediction as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning manner, and a block attention method that learns the context prediction task. With experiments on reading comprehension, we show that BLANC outperforms the state-ofthe-art QA models, and the performance gap increases as the number of answer text occurrences increases. We also conduct an experiment of training the models using SQuAD and predicting the supporting facts on HotpotQA and show that BLANC outperforms all baseline models in this zero-shot setting.","{'sequence': 'Extractive QA models have shown very promising performance in predicting the correct answer to a question for a given passage.

Question Answering,IIRC: A Dataset of Incomplete Information Reading Comprehension Questions,"Humans often have to read multiple documents to address their information needs. However, most existing reading comprehension (RC) tasks only focus on questions for which the contexts provide all the information required to answer them, thus not evaluating a system's performance at identifying a potential lack of sufficient information and locating sources for that information. To fill this gap, we present a dataset, IIRC, with more than 13K questions over paragraphs from English Wikipedia that provide only partial information to answer them, with the missing information occurring in one or more linked documents. The questions were written by crowd workers who did not have access to any of the linked documents, leading to questions that have little lexical overlap with the contexts where the answers appear. This process also gave many questions without answers, and those that require discrete reasoning, increasing the difficulty of the task.

Question Answering,Look at the First Sentence: Position Bias in Question Answering,"Many extractive question answering models are trained to predict start and end positions of answers. The choice of predicting answers as positions is mainly due to its simplicity and effectiveness. In this study, we hypothesize that when the distribution of the answer positions is highly skewed in the training set (e.g., answers lie only in the k-th sentence of each passage), QA models predicting answers as positions can learn spurious positional cues and fail to give answers in different positions. We first illustrate this position bias in popular extractive QA models such as BiDAF and BERT and thoroughly examine how position bias propagates through each layer of BERT. To safely deliver position information without position bias, we train models with various de-biasing methods including entropy regularization and bias ensembling. Among them, we found that using the prior distribution of answer positions as a bias model is very effective at reducing position bias, recovering the performance of BERT from 37.48% to 81.64% when trained on a biased SQuAD dataset.","{'sequence': 'Many extractive question answering models are trained to predict start and end positions of answers.

Question Answering,SubjQA: A Dataset for Subjectivity and Review Comprehension,"Subjectivity is the expression of internal opinions or beliefs which cannot be objectively observed or verified, and has been shown to be important for sentiment analysis and wordsense disambiguation. Furthermore, subjectivity is an important aspect of user-generated data.

We develop a new dataset which allows us to investigate this relationship. We find that subjectivity is an important feature in the case of QA, albeit with more intricate interactions between subjectivity and QA performance than found in previous work on sentiment analysis.

Question Answering,AmbigQA: Answering Ambiguous Open-domain Questions,"Ambiguity is inherent to open-domain question answering; especially when exploring new topics, it can be difficult to ask questions that have a single, unambiguous answer. In this paper, we introduce AMBIGQA, a new open-domain question answering task which involves finding every plausible answer, and then rewriting the question for each one to resolve the ambiguity. To study this task, we construct AMBIGNQ, a dataset covering 14,042 questions from NQ-OPEN, an existing opendomain QA benchmark. We find that over half of the questions in NQ-OPEN are ambiguous, with diverse sources of ambiguity such as event and entity references. We also present strong baseline models for AMBIGQA which we show benefit from weakly supervised learning that incorporates NQ-OPEN, strongly suggesting our new task and data will support significant future research effort.

Question Answering,Few-Shot Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Meta Reinforcement Learning,"Complex question-answering (CQA) involves answering complex natural-language questions on a knowledge base (KB). However, the conventional neural program induction (NPI) approach exhibits uneven performance when the questions have different types, harboring inherently different characteristics, e.g., difficulty level.

The meta-learned policy is then used to learn a good programming policy, utilizing the trial trajectories and their rewards for similar questions in the support set.

Question Answering,More Bang for Your Buck: Natural Perturbation for Robust Question Answering,"Deep learning models for linguistic tasks require large training datasets, which are expensive to create. As an alternative to the traditional approach of creating new instances by repeating the process of creating one instance, we propose doing so by first collecting a set of seed examples and then applying humandriven natural perturbations (as opposed to rule-based machine perturbations), which often change the gold label as well. Such perturbations have the advantage of being relatively easier (and hence cheaper) to create than writing out completely new examples. Further, they help address the issue that even models achieving human-level scores on NLP datasets are known to be considerably sensitive to small changes in input. To evaluate the idea, we consider a recent question-answering dataset (BOOLQ) and study our approach as a function of the perturbation cost ratio, the relative cost of perturbing an existing question vs. creating a new one from scratch. We find that when natural perturbations are moderately cheaper to create (cost ratio under 60%), it is more effective to use them for training BOOLQ models: such models exhibit 9% higher robustness and 4.5% stronger generalization, while retaining performance on the original BOOLQ dataset.","{'sequence': 'Deep learning models for linguistic tasks require large training datasets, which are expensive to create.

Question Answering,ISAAQ - Mastering Textbook Questions with Pre-trained Transformers and Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention,"Textbook Question Answering is a complex task in the intersection of Machine Comprehension and Visual Question Answering that requires reasoning with multimodal information from text and diagrams. For the first time, this paper taps on the potential of transformer language models and bottom-up and top-down attention to tackle the language and visual understanding challenges this task entails. Rather than training a language-visual transformer from scratch we rely on pretrained transformers, fine-tuning and ensembling. We add bottom-up and top-down attention to identify regions of interest corresponding to diagram constituents and their relationships, improving the selection of relevant visual information for each question and answer options.

Question Answering,What do Models Learn from Question Answering Datasets?,"While models have reached superhuman performance on popular question answering (QA) datasets such as SQuAD, they have yet to outperform humans on the task of question answering itself. In this paper, we investigate if models are learning reading comprehension from QA datasets by evaluating BERT-based models across five datasets. We evaluate models on their generalizability to out-of-domain examples, responses to missing or incorrect data, and ability to handle question variations. We find that no single dataset is robust to all of our experiments and identify shortcomings in both datasets and evaluation methods. Following our analysis, we make recommendations for building future QA datasets that better evaluate the task of question answering through reading comprehension.

Question Answering,Learning a Cost-Effective Annotation Policy for Question Answering,"State-of-the-art question answering (QA) relies upon large amounts of training data for which labeling is time consuming and thus expensive. For this reason, customizing QA systems is challenging. As a remedy, we propose a novel framework for annotating QA datasets that entails learning a cost-effective annotation policy and a semi-supervised annotation scheme. The latter reduces the human effort: it leverages the underlying QA system to suggest potential candidate annotations. Human annotators then simply provide binary feedback on these candidates. Our system is designed such that past annotations continuously improve the future performance and thus overall annotation cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the problem of annotating questions with minimal annotation cost. We compare our framework against traditional manual annotations in an extensive set of experiments. We find that our approach can reduce up to 21.1% of the annotation cost.","{'sequence': 'State-of-the-art question answering (QA) relies upon large amounts of training data for which labeling is time consuming and thus expensive.

Question Answering,Unsupervised Question Decomposition for Question Answering,"We aim to improve question answering (QA) by decomposing hard questions into simpler sub-questions that existing QA systems are capable of answering. Since labeling questions with decompositions is cumbersome, we take an unsupervised approach to produce sub-questions, also enabling us to leverage millions of questions from the internet.

We answer sub-questions with an off-the-shelf QA model and give the resulting answers to a recomposition model that combines them into a final answer. We show large QA improvements on HOTPOTQA over a strong baseline on the original, out-ofdomain, and multi-hop dev sets. ONUS automatically learns to decompose different kinds of questions, while matching the utility of supervised and heuristic decomposition methods for QA and exceeding those methods in fluency.

Question Answering,A Simple and Effective Model for Answering Multi-span Questions,"Models for reading comprehension (RC) commonly restrict their output space to the set of all single contiguous spans from the input, in order to alleviate the learning problem and avoid the need for a model that generates text explicitly. However, forcing an answer to be a single span can be restrictive, and some recent datasets also include multi-span questions, i.e., questions whose answer is a set of non-contiguous spans in the text. Naturally, models that return single spans cannot answer these questions. In this work, we propose a simple architecture for answering multi-span questions by casting the task as a sequence tagging problem, namely, predicting for each input token whether it should be part of the output or not. Our model substantially improves performance on span extraction questions from DROP and QUOREF by 9.9 and 5.5 EM points respectively.","{'sequence': 'Models for reading comprehension (RC) commonly restrict their output space to the set of all single contiguous spans from the input, in order to alleviate the learning problem and avoid the need for a model that generates text explicitly.

Each answer is accompanied by its veracity label and associated evidence sentences, providing a valuable testbed for evidence-based fact checking tasks in QA settings. We further propose a novel neural model with tailored evidence ranking components to handle the concerned answer veracity prediction problem. Extensive experiments are conducted with our proposed model and various existing fact checking methods, showing that our method outperforms all baselines on this task.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10313151776790619, 0.06908328831195831, 0.06879416108131409, 0.06342846900224686, 0.060688186436891556, 0.05833560973405838, 0.055184394121170044, 0.04796928912401199, 0.04528268799185753, 0.04454220458865166, 0.043007493019104004, 0.04176686331629753, 0.03936697542667389, 0.03846794366836548, 0.037669871002435684, 0.03520048409700394, 0.03149745613336563, 0.03063671477138996, 0.023644454777240753, 0.01965424418449402, 0.018456369638442993, 0.01246223971247673, 0.011729097925126553]}",0.10313151776790619,Question Answering,0.10313151776790619
Question Answering,Don't Read Too Much Into It: Adaptive Computation for Open-Domain Question Answering,"Most approaches to Open-Domain Question Answering consist of a light-weight retriever that selects a set of candidate passages, and a computationally expensive reader that examines the passages to identify the correct answer. Previous works have shown that as the number of retrieved passages increases, so does the performance of the reader. However, they assume all retrieved passages are of equal importance and allocate the same amount of computation to them, leading to a substantial increase in computational cost. To reduce this cost, we propose the use of adaptive computation to control the computational budget allocated for the passages to be read. We first introduce a technique operating on individual passages in isolation which relies on anytime prediction and a per-layer estimation of an early exit probability. We then introduce SKY-LINEBUILDER, an approach for dynamically deciding on which passage to allocate computation at each step, based on a resource allocation policy trained via reinforcement learning. Our results on SQuAD-Open show that adaptive computation with global prioritisation improves over several strong static and adaptive methods, leading to a 4.3x reduction in computation while retaining 95% performance of the full model.","{'sequence': 'Most approaches to Open-Domain Question Answering consist of a light-weight retriever that selects a set of candidate passages, and a computationally expensive reader that examines the passages to identify the correct answer.

Question Answering,Unsupervised Adaptation of Question Answering Systems via Generative Self-training,"BERT-era question answering systems have recently achieved impressive performance on several question-answering (QA) tasks. These systems are based on representations that have been pre-trained on self-supervised tasks such as word masking and sentence entailment, using massive amounts of data. Nevertheless, additional pre-training closer to the end-task, such as training on synthetic QA pairs, has been shown to improve performance. While recent work has considered augmenting labelled data and leveraging large unlabelled datasets to generate synthetic QA data, directly adapting to target data has received little attention. In this paper we investigate the iterative generation of synthetic QA pairs as a way to realize unsupervised self adaptation. Motivated by the success of the roundtrip consistency method for filtering generated QA pairs, we present iterative generalizations of the approach, which maximize an approximation of a lower bound on the probability of the adaptation data. By adapting on synthetic QA pairs generated on the target data, our method is able to improve QA systems significantly, using an order of magnitude less synthetic data and training computation than existing augmentation approaches.","{'sequence': 'BERT-era question answering systems have recently achieved impressive performance on several question-answering (QA) tasks.

Question Answering,PRover: Proof Generation for Interpretable Reasoning over Rules,"Recent work by Clark et al. (2020) shows that transformers can act as ""soft theorem provers"" by answering questions over explicitly provided knowledge in natural language. In our work, we take a step closer to emulating formal theorem provers, by proposing PROVER, an interpretable transformer-based model that jointly answers binary questions over rule-bases and generates the corresponding proofs. Our model learns to predict nodes and edges corresponding to proof graphs in an efficient constrained training paradigm. During inference, a valid proof, satisfying a set of global constraints is generated. We conduct experiments on synthetic, hand-authored, and human-paraphrased rule-bases to show promising results for QA and proof generation, with strong generalization performance. First, PROVER generates proofs with an accuracy of 87%, while retaining or improving performance on the QA task, compared to RuleTakers (up to 6% improvement on zero-shot evaluation). Second, when trained on questions requiring lower depths of reasoning, it generalizes significantly better to higher depths (up to 15% improvement). Third, PROVER obtains near perfect QA accuracy of 98% using only 40% of the training data. However, generating proofs for questions requiring higher depths of reasoning becomes challenging, and the accuracy drops to 65% for ""depth 5"", indicating significant scope for future work. 1 Facts : F 1 : The bald eagle eats the lion.

(2020) shows that transformers can act as ""soft theorem provers"" by answering questions over explicitly provided knowledge in natural language. In our work, we take a step closer to emulating formal theorem provers, by proposing PROVER, an interpretable transformer-based model that jointly answers binary questions over rule-bases and generates the corresponding proofs. Our model learns to predict nodes and edges corresponding to proof graphs in an efficient constrained training paradigm. During inference, a valid proof, satisfying a set of global constraints is generated. We conduct experiments on synthetic, hand-authored, and human-paraphrased rule-bases to show promising results for QA and proof generation, with strong generalization performance. First, PROVER generates proofs with an accuracy of 87%, while retaining or improving performance on the QA task, compared to RuleTakers (up to 6% improvement on zero-shot evaluation). Second, when trained on questions requiring lower depths of reasoning, it generalizes significantly better to higher depths (up to 15% improvement). Third, PROVER obtains near perfect QA accuracy of 98% using only 40% of the training data. However, generating proofs for questions requiring higher depths of reasoning becomes challenging, and the accuracy drops to 65% for ""depth 5"", indicating significant scope for future work. 1 Facts : F 1 : The bald eagle eats the lion.

Question Answering,Discern: Discourse-Aware Entailment Reasoning Network for Conversational Machine Reading,"Document interpretation and dialog understanding are the two major challenges for conversational machine reading. In this work, we propose DISCERN, a discourse-aware entailment reasoning network to strengthen the connection and enhance the understanding for both document and dialog. Specifically, we split the document into clause-like elementary discourse units (EDU) using a pre-trained discourse segmentation model, and we train our model in a weakly-supervised manner to predict whether each EDU is entailed by the user feedback in a conversation. Based on the learned EDU and entailment representations, we either reply to the user our final decision ""yes/no/irrelevant"" of the initial question, or generate a follow-up question to inquiry more information. Our experiments on the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set) show that DISCERN achieves state-ofthe-art results of 78.3% macro-averaged accuracy on decision making and 64.0 BLEU1 on follow-up question generation.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Sparsity Makes Sense: Word Sense Disambiguation Using Sparse Contextualized Word Representations,"In this paper, we demonstrate that by utilizing sparse word representations, it becomes possible to surpass the results of more complex task-specific models on the task of finegrained all-words word sense disambiguation. Our proposed algorithm relies on an overcomplete set of semantic basis vectors that allows us to obtain sparse contextualized word representations. We introduce such an information theory-inspired synset representation based on the co-occurrence of word senses and nonzero coordinates for word forms which allows us to achieve an aggregated F-score of 78.8 over a combination of five standard word sense disambiguating benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the general applicability of our proposed framework by evaluating it towards part-of-speech tagging on four different treebanks. Our results indicate a significant improvement over the application of the dense word representations.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we demonstrate that by utilizing sparse word representations, it becomes possible to surpass the results of more complex task-specific models on the task of finegrained all-words word sense disambiguation.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,With More Contexts Comes Better Performance: Contextualized Sense Embeddings for All-Round Word Sense Disambiguation,"Contextualized word embeddings have been employed effectively across several tasks in Natural Language Processing, as they have proved to carry useful semantic information. However, it is still hard to link them to structured sources of knowledge. In this paper we present ARES (context-AwaRe Embeddings of Senses), a semi-supervised approach to producing sense embeddings for the lexical meanings within a lexical knowledge base that lie in a space that is comparable to that of contextualized word vectors. ARES representations enable a simple 1-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm to outperform state-of-the-art models, not only in the English Word Sense Disambiguation task, but also in the multilingual one, whilst training on sense-annotated data in English only. We further assess the quality of our embeddings in the Word-in-Context task, where, when used as an external source of knowledge, they consistently improve the performance of a neural model, leading it to compete with other more complex architectures.

In this paper, we present a Program-enhanced Verbalization and Graph ATtention Network (ProgVGAT) to integrate programs and execution into textual inference models. Specifically, a verbalization with program execution model is proposed to accumulate evidences that are embedded in operations over the tables. Built on that, we construct the graph attention verification networks, which are designed to fuse different sources of evidences from verbalized program execution, program structures, and the original statements and tables, to make the final verification decision. To support the above framework, we propose a program selection module optimized with a new training strategy based on margin loss, to produce more accurate programs, which is shown to be effective in enhancing the final verification results.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",A Bilingual Generative Transformer for Semantic Sentence Embedding,"Semantic sentence embedding models encode natural language sentences into vectors, such that closeness in embedding space indicates closeness in the semantics between the sentences. Bilingual data offers a useful signal for learning such embeddings: properties shared by both sentences in a translation pair are likely semantic, while divergent properties are likely stylistic or language-specific. We propose a deep latent variable model that attempts to perform source separation on parallel sentences, isolating what they have in common in a latent semantic vector, and explaining what is left over with language-specific latent vectors. Our proposed approach differs from past work on semantic sentence encoding in two ways. First, by using a variational probabilistic framework, we introduce priors that encourage source separation, and can use our model's posterior to predict sentence embeddings for monolingual data at test time. Second, we use high-capacity transformers as both data generating distributions and inference networkscontrasting with most past work on sentence embeddings. In experiments, our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on a standard suite of unsupervised semantic similarity evaluations.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",ConjNLI: Natural Language Inference Over Conjunctive Sentences,"Reasoning about conjuncts in conjunctive sentences is important for a deeper understanding of conjunctions in English and also how their usages and semantics differ from conjunctive and disjunctive boolean logic. Existing NLI stress tests do not consider non-boolean usages of conjunctions and use templates for testing such model knowledge. Hence, we introduce CONJNLI, a challenge stress-test for natural language inference over conjunctive sentences, where the premise differs from the hypothesis by conjuncts removed, added, or replaced. These sentences contain single and multiple instances of coordinating conjunctions (""and"", ""or"", ""but"", ""nor"") with quantifiers, negations, and requiring diverse boolean and non-boolean inferences over conjuncts. We find that large-scale pre-trained language models like RoBERTa do not understand conjunctive semantics well and resort to shallow heuristics to make inferences over such sentences. As some initial solutions, we first present an iterative adversarial fine-tuning method that uses synthetically created training data based on boolean and non-boolean heuristics. We also propose a direct model advancement by making RoBERTa aware of predicate semantic roles. While we observe some performance gains, CONJNLI is still challenging for current methods, thus encouraging interesting future work for better understanding of conjunctions. 1","{'sequence': 'Reasoning about conjuncts in conjunctive sentences is important for a deeper understanding of conjunctions in English and also how their usages and semantics differ from conjunctive and disjunctive boolean logic.

It uses automatic paraphrasing combined with templatebased parsing to find alternative expressions of an attribute in different parts of speech. It also uses a novel filtered auto-paraphraser to generate correct paraphrases of entire sentences. We apply AutoQA to the Schema2QA dataset and obtain an average logical form accuracy of 62.9% when tested on natural questions, which is only 6.4% lower than a model trained with expert natural language annotations and paraphrase data collected from crowdworkers. To demonstrate the generality of AutoQA, we also apply it to the Overnight dataset.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",A Dataset for Tracking Entities in Open Domain Procedural Text,"We present the first dataset for tracking state changes in procedural text from arbitrary domains by using an unrestricted (open) vocabulary.

Previous formulations of this task provide the text and entities involved, and ask how those entities change for just a small, pre-defined set of attributes (e.g., location), limiting their fidelity. Our solution is a new task formulation where given just a procedural text as input, the task is to generate a set of state change tuples (entity, attribute, before-state, after-state) for each step, where the entity, attribute, and state values must be predicted from an open vocabulary.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight extension on top of BERT and a novel self-supervised learning objective based on mutual information maximization strategies to derive meaningful sentence embeddings in an unsupervised manner.

This work proposes an adaptive attentional network for few-shot KG completion by learning adaptive entity and reference representations. Specifically, entities are modeled by an adaptive neighbor encoder to discern their task-oriented roles, while references are modeled by an adaptive query-aware aggregator to differentiate their contributions. Through the attention mechanism, both entities and references can capture their fine-grained semantic meanings, and thus render more expressive representations. This will be more predictive for knowledge acquisition in the few-shot scenario.

We perform an ablation on two Winograd Schema datasets that interpolates between the formalizations used before and after this surge, and find (i) framing the task as multiple choice improves performance by 2-6 points and (ii) several additional techniques, including the reuse of a pretrained language modeling head, can mitigate the model's extreme sensitivity to hyperparameters.

A thorough experimental study on UNIMER reveals that neural semantic parsing approaches exhibit notably different performance when they are trained to generate different meaning representations. Also, program alias and grammar rules heavily impact the performance of different meaning representations.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Improving AMR Parsing with Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training,"In the literature, the research on abstract meaning representation (AMR) parsing is much restricted by the size of human-curated dataset which is critical to build an AMR parser with good performance. To alleviate such data size restriction, pre-trained models have been drawing more and more attention in AMR parsing. However, previous pre-trained models, like BERT, are implemented for general purpose which may not work as expected for the specific task of AMR parsing. In this paper, we focus on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) AMR parsing and propose a seq2seq pre-training approach to build pre-trained models in both single and joint way on three relevant tasks, i.e., machine translation, syntactic parsing, and AMR parsing itself. Moreover, we extend the vanilla fine-tuning method to a multi-task learning fine-tuning method that optimizes for the performance of AMR parsing while endeavors to preserve the response of pre-trained models. Extensive experimental results on two English benchmark datasets show that both the single and joint pre-trained models significantly improve the performance (e.g., from 71.5 to 80.2 on AMR 2.0), which reaches the state of the art. The result is very encouraging since we achieve this with seq2seq models rather than complex models.

To alleviate the dependence on labeled data, prior works mainly focused on feature-based adaptation, which used the domain-shared knowledge to construct auxiliary tasks or domain adversarial learning to bridge the gap between domains, while ignored the attribute of instance-based adaptation. To resolve this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework to jointly perform feature and instance based adaptation for the ABSA task in this paper. Based on BERT, we learn domain-invariant feature representations by using part-of-speech features and syntactic dependency relations to construct auxiliary tasks, and jointly perform word-level instance weighting in the framework of sequence labeling. Experiment results on four benchmarks show that the proposed method can achieve significant improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-arts in both tasks of cross-domain End2End ABSA and crossdomain aspect extraction.","{'sequence': 'The supervised models for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) rely heavily on labeled data.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Train No Evil: Selective Masking for Task-Guided Pre-Training,"Recently, pre-trained language models mostly follow the pre-train-then-fine-tuning paradigm and have achieved great performance on various downstream tasks. However, since the pretraining stage is typically task-agnostic and the fine-tuning stage usually suffers from insufficient supervised data, the models cannot always well capture the domain-specific and task-specific patterns. In this paper, we propose a three-stage framework by adding a task-guided pre-training stage with selective masking between general pre-training and finetuning. In this stage, the model is trained by masked language modeling on in-domain unsupervised data to learn domain-specific patterns and we propose a novel selective masking strategy to learn task-specific patterns. Specifically, we design a method to measure the importance of each token in sequences and selectively mask the important tokens. Experimental results on two sentiment analysis tasks show that our method can achieve comparable or even better performance with less than 50% of computation cost, which indicates our method is both effective and efficient.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Extracting Implicitly Asserted Propositions in Argumentation,"Argumentation accommodates various rhetorical devices, such as questions, reported speech, and imperatives. These rhetorical tools usually assert argumentatively relevant propositions rather implicitly, so understanding their true meaning is key to understanding certain arguments properly.

However, existing ABSA test sets cannot be used to probe whether a model can distinguish the sentiment of the target aspect from the non-target aspects. To solve this problem, we develop a simple but effective approach to enrich ABSA test sets. Specifically, we generate new examples to disentangle the confounding sentiments of the non-target aspects from the target aspect's sentiment. Based on the SemEval 2014 dataset, we construct the Aspect Robustness Test Set (ARTS) as a comprehensive probe of the aspect robustness of ABSA models. Over 92% data of ARTS show high fluency and desired sentiment on all aspects by human evaluation. Using ARTS, we analyze the robustness of nine ABSA models, and observe, surprisingly, that their accuracy drops by up to 69.73%.

The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and our further analysis shows that our model can capture aspect-specific opinion spans. 1', 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.11499200761318207, 0.08127652108669281, 0.060864485800266266, 0.05779300630092621, 0.05503254011273384, 0.04970662668347359, 0.04898810759186745, 0.04852331802248955, 0.047654345631599426, 0.04614248871803284, 0.045650236308574677, 0.0405891016125679, 0.04013314098119736, 0.038316067308187485, 0.03697657585144043, 0.03090118244290352, 0.030502617359161377, 0.028565412387251854, 0.02826300822198391, 0.021965108811855316, 0.02017110586166382, 0.014836977235972881, 0.012156053446233273]}",0.11499200761318207,Information Extraction,0.012156053446233273
"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks with Relational Position Encodings for Emotion Recognition in Conversations,"Interest in emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has been increasing in various fields, because it can be used to analyze user behaviors and detect fake news. Many recent ERC methods use graph-based neural networks to take the relationships between the utterances of the speakers into account. In particular, the state-of-the-art method considers self-and inter-speaker dependencies in conversations by using relational graph attention networks (RGAT). However, graph-based neural networks do not take sequential information into account. In this paper, we propose relational position encodings that provide RGAT with sequential information reflecting the relational graph structure. Accordingly, our RGAT model can capture both the speaker dependency and the sequential information. Experiments on four ERC datasets show that our model is beneficial to recognizing emotions expressed in conversations.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",End-to-End Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction based on Sliding Window Multi-Label Learning,"Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) is a new task that aims to extract the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. The existing methods first perform emotion extraction and cause extraction independently, and then perform emotion-cause pairing and filtering. However, the above methods ignore the fact that the cause and the emotion it triggers are inseparable, and the extraction of the cause without specifying the emotion is pathological, which greatly limits the performance of the above methods in the first step. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose two joint frameworks for ECPE: 1) multi-label learning for the extraction of the cause clauses corresponding to the specified emotion clause (CMLL) and 2) multi-label learning for the extraction of the emotion clauses corresponding to the specified cause clause (EMLL). The window of multilabel learning is centered on the specified emotion clause or cause clause and slides as their positions move. Finally, CMLL and EMLL are integrated to obtain the final result. We evaluate our model on a benchmark emotion cause corpus, the results show that our approach achieves the best performance among all compared systems on the ECPE task.","{'sequence': 'Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) is a new task that aims to extract the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Feature Adaptation of Pre-Trained Language Models across Languages and Domains with Robust Self-Training,"Adapting pre-trained language models (PrLMs) (e.g., BERT) to new domains has gained much attention recently. Instead of fine-tuning PrLMs as done in most previous work, we investigate how to adapt the features of PrLMs to new domains without fine-tuning. We explore unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in this paper. With the features from PrLMs, we adapt the models trained with labeled data from the source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Self-training is widely used for UDA, and it predicts pseudo labels on the target domain data for training. However, the predicted pseudo labels inevitably include noise, which will negatively affect training a robust model. To improve the robustness of self-training, in this paper we present class-aware feature self-distillation (CFd) to learn discriminative features from PrLMs, in which PrLM features are self-distilled into a feature adaptation module and the features from the same class are more tightly clustered. We further extend CFd to a cross-language setting, in which language discrepancy is studied. Experiments on two monolingual and multilingual Amazon review datasets show that CFd can consistently improve the performance of self-training in cross-domain and cross-language settings.","{'sequence': 'Adapting pre-trained language models (PrLMs) (e.g., BERT) to new domains has gained much attention recently.

Speech and Multimodality,Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection,"Most existing approaches to disfluency detection heavily rely on human-annotated corpora, which is expensive to obtain in practice. There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require humanannotated corpora.

Speech and Multimodality,Simultaneous Machine Translation with Visual Context,"Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) aims to translate a continuous input text stream into another language with the lowest latency and highest quality possible. The translation thus has to start with an incomplete source text, which is read progressively, creating the need for anticipation.

To this end, we analyse the impact of different multimodal approaches and visual features on state-of-the-art SiMT frameworks. Our results show that visual context is helpful and that visually-grounded models based on explicit object region information are much better than commonly used global features, reaching up to 3 BLEU points improvement under low latency scenarios.

Summarization,Stepwise Extractive Summarization and Planning with Structured Transformers,"We propose encoder-centric stepwise models for extractive summarization using structured transformers -HiBERT (Zhang et al.,  2019) and Extended Transformers (Ainslie  et al., 2020). We enable stepwise summarization by injecting the previously generated summary into the structured transformer as an auxiliary sub-structure. Our models are not only efficient in modeling the structure of long inputs, but they also do not rely on task-specific redundancy-aware modeling, making them a general purpose extractive content planner for different tasks. When evaluated on CNN/DailyMail extractive summarization, stepwise models achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of Rouge without any redundancy aware modeling or sentence filtering. This also holds true for Rotowire tableto-text generation, where our models surpass previously reported metrics for content selection, planning and ordering, highlighting the strength of stepwise modeling. Amongst the two structured transformers we test, stepwise Extended Transformers provides the best performance across both datasets and sets a new standard for these challenges. 1 * Equal contribution. 1 The code and data are available at https://github. com/google-research/google-research/ tree/master/etcsum.","{'sequence': 'We propose encoder-centric stepwise models for extractive summarization using structured transformers -HiBERT (Zhang et al.,  2019) and Extended Transformers (Ainslie  et al., 2020).

Summarization,"Diverse, Controllable, and Keyphrase-Aware: A Corpus and Method for News Multi-Headline Generation","News headline generation aims to produce a short sentence to attract readers to read the news. One news article often contains multiple keyphrases that are of interest to different users, which can naturally have multiple reasonable headlines. However, most existing methods focus on the single headline generation. In this paper, we propose generating multiple headlines with keyphrases of user interests, whose main idea is to generate multiple keyphrases of interest to users for the news first, and then generate multiple keyphrase-relevant headlines. We propose a multi-source Transformer decoder, which takes three sources as inputs: (a) keyphrase, (b) keyphrase-filtered article, and (c) original article to generate keyphrase-relevant, highquality, and diverse headlines. Furthermore, we propose a simple and effective method to mine the keyphrases of interest in the news article and build a first large-scale keyphraseaware news headline corpus, which contains over 180K aligned triples of news article, headline, keyphrase .

Summarization,On Extractive and Abstractive Neural Document Summarization with Transformer Language Models,"We present a method to produce abstractive summaries of long documents that exceed several thousand words via neural abstractive summarization. We perform a simple extractive step before generating a summary, which is then used to condition the transformer language model on relevant information before being tasked with generating a summary. We also show that this approach produces more abstractive summaries compared to prior work that employs a copy mechanism while still achieving higher ROUGE scores. We provide extensive comparisons with strong baseline methods, prior state of the art work as well as multiple variants of our approach including those using only transformers, only extractive techniques and combinations of the two. We examine these models using four different summarization tasks and datasets: arXiv papers, PubMed papers, the Newsroom and BigPatent datasets. We find that transformer based methods produce summaries with fewer n-gram copies, leading to n-gram copying statistics that are more similar to human generated abstracts. We include a human evaluation, finding that transformers are ranked highly for coherence and fluency, but purely extractive methods score higher for informativeness and relevance. We hope that these architectures and experiments may serve as strong points of comparison for future work.","{'sequence': 'We present a method to produce abstractive summaries of long documents that exceed several thousand words via neural abstractive summarization.

Primarily, we find that 1) under similar settings, extractive summarizers are in general better than their abstractive counterparts thanks to strength in faithfulness and factual-consistency; 2) milestone techniques such as copy, coverage and hybrid extractive/abstractive methods do bring specific improvements but also demonstrate limitations; 3) pre-training techniques, and in particular sequence-to-sequence pre-training, are highly effective for improving text summarization, with BART giving the best results. * Equal contribution. † Corresponding author. 1 MQM is a framework for declaring and describing human writing quality which stipulates a hierarchical listing of error types restricted to human writing and translation.', 'labels': ['Summarization', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1011057123541832, 0.06347417831420898, 0.0589132122695446, 0.05742662772536278, 0.057369302958250046, 0.054000165313482285, 0.05371725931763649, 0.05291864275932312, 0.05062646418809891, 0.04545111209154129, 0.042902491986751556, 0.04175780341029167, 0.04037941247224808, 0.039762694388628006, 0.03423351049423218, 0.032323725521564484, 0.031985923647880554, 0.03166237100958824, 0.026570802554488182, 0.026225030422210693, 0.024440521374344826, 0.01826135814189911, 0.014491597190499306]}",0.1011057123541832,Summarization,0.1011057123541832

Summarization,A Spectral Method for Unsupervised Multi-Document Summarization,"Multi-document summarization (MDS) aims at producing a good-quality summary for several related documents. In this paper, we propose a spectral-based hypothesis, which states that the goodness of summary candidate is closely linked to its so-called spectral impact. Here spectral impact considers the perturbation to the dominant eigenvalue of affinity matrix when dropping the summary candidate from the document cluster. The hypothesis is validated by three theoretical perspectives: semantic scaling, propagation dynamics and matrix perturbation. According to the hypothesis, we formulate the MDS task as the combinatorial optimization of spectral impact and propose an accelerated greedy solution based on a surrogate of spectral impact. The evaluation results on various datasets demonstrate: (1) The performance of the summary candidate is positively correlated with its spectral impact, which accords with our hypothesis; (2) Our spectral-based method has a competitive result as compared to state-of-the-art MDS systems.","{'sequence': 'Multi-document summarization (MDS) aims at producing a good-quality summary for several related documents.

In this work, we propose to evaluate the summary qualities without reference summaries by unsupervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we design a new metric which covers both linguistic qualities and semantic informativeness based on BERT. To learn the metric, for each summary, we construct different types of negative samples with respect to different aspects of the summary qualities, and train our model with a ranking loss.

Summarization,Evaluating the Factual Consistency of Abstractive Text Summarization,"The most common metrics for assessing summarization algorithms do not account for whether summaries are factually consistent with source documents. We propose a weakly-supervised, model-based approach for verifying factual consistency and identifying conflicts between source documents and generated summaries. Training data is generated by applying a series of rule-based transformations to the sentences of source documents. The factual consistency model is then trained jointly for three tasks: 1) predict whether each summary sentence is factually consistent or not, 2) in either case, extract a span in the source document to support this consistency prediction, 3) for each summary sentence that is deemed inconsistent, extract the inconsistent span from it. Transferring this model to summaries generated by several neural models reveals that this highly scalable approach outperforms previous models, including those trained with strong supervision using datasets from related domains, such as natural language inference and fact checking. Additionally, human evaluation shows that the auxiliary span extraction tasks provide useful assistance in the process of verifying factual consistency.

Experiments on large scale benchmark corpus (CNN/DM, NYT, and NEWSROOM) demonstrate that HAHSum yields ground-breaking performance and outperforms previous extractive summarizers.', 'labels': ['Summarization', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.21932753920555115, 0.11129969358444214, 0.09473363310098648, 0.06842868030071259, 0.04963742196559906, 0.04345002770423889, 0.034517012536525726, 0.03306533396244049, 0.03286616504192352, 0.03255484625697136, 0.02848801016807556, 0.02795262075960636, 0.02736077271401882, 0.02486288547515869, 0.022728104144334793, 0.022077932953834534, 0.020954450592398643, 0.020897256210446358, 0.020244361832737923, 0.01887715607881546, 0.017704477533698082, 0.01738153211772442, 0.010590163059532642]}",0.21932753920555115,Summarization,0.21932753920555115
Summarization,Pre-training for Abstractive Document Summarization by Reinstating Source Text,"Abstractive document summarization is usually modeled as a sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ) learning problem. Unfortunately, training large SEQ2SEQ based summarization models on limited supervised summarization data is challenging. This paper presents three sequence-to-sequence pre-training (in shorthand, STEP) objectives which allow us to pre-train a SEQ2SEQ based abstractive summarization model on unlabeled text. The main idea is that, given an input text artificially constructed from a document, a model is pre-trained to reinstate the original document. These objectives include sentence reordering, next sentence generation and masked document generation, which have close relations with the abstractive document summarization task. Experiments on two benchmark summarization datasets (i.e., CNN/DailyMail and New York Times) show that all three objectives can improve performance upon baselines. Compared to models pre-trained on large-scale data (≥160GB), our method, with only 19GB text for pre-training, achieves comparable results, which demonstrates its effectiveness.

Summarization,Few-Shot Learning for Opinion Summarization,"Opinion summarization is the automatic creation of text reflecting subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as user reviews of a product. The task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention. However, due to the high cost of summary production, datasets large enough for training supervised models are lacking. Instead, the task has been traditionally approached with extractive methods that learn to select text fragments in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised way. Recently, it has been shown that abstractive summaries, potentially more fluent and better at reflecting conflicting information, can also be produced in an unsupervised fashion. However, these models, not being exposed to actual summaries, fail to capture their essential properties. In this work, we show that even a handful of summaries is sufficient to bootstrap generation of the summary text with all expected properties, such as writing style, informativeness, fluency, and sentiment preservation. We start by training a conditional Transformer language model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the product. The model is also conditioned on review properties that are directly related to summaries; the properties are derived from reviews with no manual effort. In the second stage, we fine-tune a plug-in module that learns to predict property values on a handful of summaries. This lets us switch the generator to the summarization mode. We show on Amazon and Yelp datasets that our approach substantially outperforms previous extractive and abstractive methods in automatic and human evaluation.","{'sequence': 'Opinion summarization is the automatic creation of text reflecting subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as user reviews of a product.

Summarization,TESA: A Task in Entity Semantic Aggregation for Abstractive Summarization,"Human-written texts contain frequent generalizations and semantic aggregation of content.

We then build baseline models for generating aggregations given a tuple of entities and document context.

Summarization,Q-learning with Language Model for Edit-based Unsupervised Summarization,"Unsupervised methods are promising for abstractive textsummarization in that the parallel corpora is not required. However, their performance is still far from being satisfied, therefore research on promising solutions is on-going. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on Q-learning with an edit-based summarization. The method combines two key modules to form an Editorial Agent and Language Model converter (EALM). The agent predicts edit actions (e.t., delete, keep, and replace), and then the LM converter deterministically generates a summary on the basis of the action signals. Qlearning is leveraged to train the agent to produce proper edit actions. Experimental results show that EALM delivered competitive performance compared with the previous encoderdecoder-based methods, even with truly zero paired data (i.e., no validation set). Defining the task as Q-learning enables us not only to develop a competitive method but also to make the latest techniques in reinforcement learning available for unsupervised summarization.

Summarization,Understanding Neural Abstractive Summarization Models via Uncertainty,"An advantage of seq2seq abstractive summarization models is that they generate text in a free-form manner, but this flexibility makes it difficult to interpret model behavior. In this work, we analyze summarization decoders in both blackbox and whitebox ways by studying on the entropy, or uncertainty, of the model's token-level predictions. For two strong pretrained models, PEGASUS (Zhang et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020)  on two summarization datasets, we find a strong correlation between low prediction entropy and where the model copies tokens rather than generating novel text. The decoder's uncertainty also connects to factors like sentence position and syntactic distance between adjacent pairs of tokens, giving a sense of what factors make a context particularly selective for the model's next output token. Finally, we study the relationship of decoder uncertainty and attention behavior to understand how attention gives rise to these observed effects in the model. We show that uncertainty is a useful perspective for analyzing summarization and text generation models more broadly. 1","{'sequence': ""An advantage of seq2seq abstractive summarization models is that they generate text in a free-form manner, but this flexibility makes it difficult to interpret model behavior.

Summarization,Multi-View Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Conversational Structure for Abstractive Dialogue Summarization,"Text summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in NLP. Although much attention has been paid to summarizing structured text like news reports or encyclopedia articles, summarizing conversations-an essential part of humanhuman/machine interaction where most important pieces of information are scattered across various utterances of different speakersremains relatively under-investigated. This work proposes a multi-view sequence-tosequence model by first extracting conversational structures of unstructured daily chats from different views to represent conversations and then utilizing a multi-view decoder to incorporate different views to generate dialogue summaries. Experiments on a large-scale dialogue summarization corpus demonstrated that our methods significantly outperformed previous state-of-the-art models via both automatic evaluations and human judgment. We also discussed specific challenges that current approaches faced with this task.

Summarization,VMSMO: Learning to Generate Multimodal Summary for Video-based News Articles,"A popular multimedia news format nowadays is providing users with a lively video and a corresponding news article, which is employed by influential news media including CNN, BBC, and social media including Twitter and Weibo. In such a case, automatically choosing a proper cover frame of the video and generating an appropriate textual summary of the article can help editors save time, and readers make the decision more effectively. Hence, in this paper, we propose the task of Videobased Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output (VMSMO) to tackle such a problem. The main challenge in this task is to jointly model the temporal dependency of video with semantic meaning of article. To this end, we propose a Dual-Interaction-based Multimodal Summarizer (DIMS), consisting of a dual interaction module and multimodal generator. In the dual interaction module, we propose a conditional self-attention mechanism that captures local semantic information within video and a global-attention mechanism that handles the semantic relationship between news text and video from a high level.

Summarization,Compressive Summarization with Plausibility and Salience Modeling,"Compressive summarization systems typically rely on a crafted set of syntactic rules to determine what spans of possible summary sentences can be deleted, then learn a model of what to actually delete by optimizing for content selection (ROUGE). In this work, we propose to relax the rigid syntactic constraints on candidate spans and instead leave compression decisions to two data-driven criteria: plausibility and salience. Deleting a span is plausible if removing it maintains the grammaticality and factuality of a sentence, and spans are salient if they contain important information from the summary. Each of these is judged by a pre-trained Transformer model, and only deletions that are both plausible and not salient can be applied. When integrated into a simple extraction-compression pipeline, our method achieves strong in-domain results on benchmark summarization datasets, and human evaluation shows that the plausibility model generally selects for grammatical and factual deletions. Furthermore, the flexibility of our approach allows it to generalize cross-domain: our system fine-tuned on only 500 samples from a new domain can match or exceed an in-domain extractive model trained on much more data. 1","{'sequence': 'Compressive summarization systems typically rely on a crafted set of syntactic rules to determine what spans of possible summary sentences can be deleted, then learn a model of what to actually delete by optimizing for content selection (ROUGE).

To address these two issues, we propose a multistage fusion network with the fusion forget gate module, which builds upon this approach by modeling fine-grained interactions between the multisource modalities through a multistep fusion schema and controlling the flow of redundant information between multimodal long sequences via a forgetting module. Experimental results on the How2 dataset show that our proposed model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive analysis empirically verifies the effectiveness of our fusion schema and forgetting module on multiple encoder-decoder architectures. Specially, when using high noise ASR transcripts (W ER>30%), our model still achieves performance close to the ground-truth transcript model, which reduces manual annotation cost.","{'sequence': 'Multimodal summarization for open-domain videos is an emerging task, aiming to generate a summary from multisource information (video, audio, transcript).

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",On the Role of Supervision in Unsupervised Constituency Parsing,"We analyze several recent unsupervised constituency parsing models, which are tuned with respect to the parsing F 1 score on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) development set (1,700 sentences). We introduce strong baselines for them, by training an existing supervised parsing model (Kitaev and Klein, 2018)  on the same labeled examples they access. When training on the 1,700 examples, or even when using only 50 examples for training and 5 for development, such a few-shot parsing approach can outperform all the unsupervised parsing methods by a significant margin. Fewshot parsing can be further improved by a simple data augmentation method and selftraining. This suggests that, in order to arrive at fair conclusions, we should carefully consider the amount of labeled data used for model development. We propose two protocols for future work on unsupervised parsing: (i) use fully unsupervised criteria for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; (ii) use as few labeled examples as possible for model development, and compare to few-shot parsing trained on the same labeled examples. 1","{'sequence': 'We analyze several recent unsupervised constituency parsing models, which are tuned with respect to the parsing F 1 score on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) development set (1,700 sentences).

To address these problems, we propose a novel and unified framework that learns to attack a structured prediction model using a sequence-to-sequence model with feedbacks from multiple reference models of the same structured prediction task.
