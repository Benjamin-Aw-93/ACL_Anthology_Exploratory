Generation,DeepRapper: Neural Rap Generation with Rhyme and Rhythm Modeling,"Rap generation, which aims to produce lyrics and corresponding singing beats, needs to model both rhymes and rhythms. Previous works for rap generation focused on rhyming lyrics but ignored rhythmic beats, which are important for rap performance. In this paper, we develop DeepRapper, a Transformer-based rap generation system that can model both rhymes and rhythms. Since there is no available rap dataset with rhythmic beats, we develop a data mining pipeline to collect a largescale rap dataset, which includes a large number of rap songs with aligned lyrics and rhythmic beats. Second, we design a Transformerbased autoregressive language model which carefully models rhymes and rhythms. Specifically, we generate lyrics in the reverse order with rhyme representation and constraint for rhyme enhancement and insert a beat symbol into lyrics for rhythm/beat modeling. To our knowledge, DeepRapper is the first system to generate rap with both rhymes and rhythms. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that DeepRapper generates creative and high-quality raps with rhymes and rhythms.","{'sequence': 'Rap generation, which aims to produce lyrics and corresponding singing beats, needs to model both rhymes and rhythms.

Generation,PENS: A Dataset and Generic Framework for Personalized News Headline Generation,"In this paper, we formulate the personalized news headline generation problem whose goal is to output a user-specific title based on both a user's reading interests and a candidate news body to be exposed to her. To build up a benchmark for this problem, we publicize a large-scale dataset named PENS (PErsonalized News headlineS). The training set is collected from user impressions logs of Microsoft News, and the test set is manually created by hundreds of native speakers to enable a fair testbed for evaluating models in an offline mode. We propose a generic framework as a preparatory solution to our problem. At its heart, user preference is learned by leveraging the user behavioral data, and three kinds of user preference injections are proposed to personalize a text generator and establish personalized headlines. We investigate our dataset by implementing several state-of-the-art user modeling methods in our framework to demonstrate a benchmark score for the proposed dataset.

Generation,Enhancing Content Preservation in Text Style Transfer Using Reverse Attention and Conditional Layer Normalization,"Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence while preserving its content. A common approach is to map a given sentence to content representation that is free of style, and the content representation is fed to a decoder with a target style. Previous methods in filtering style completely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss of content information. In this paper, we propose to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention, and thereby retain the content. Furthermore, we fuse content information when building the target style representation, making it dynamic with respect to the content. Our method creates not only styleindependent content representation, but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation. In addition, it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and fluency.","{'sequence': 'Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence while preserving its content.

Generation,Mention Flags (MF): Constraining Transformer-based Text Generators,"This paper focuses on Seq2Seq (S2S) constrained text generation where the text generator is constrained to mention specific words, which are inputs to the encoder, in the generated outputs. Pre-trained S2S models such as T5 or a Copy Mechanism can be trained to copy the surface tokens from encoders to decoders, but they cannot guarantee constraint satisfaction. Constrained decoding algorithms always produce hypotheses satisfying all constraints. However, they are computationally expensive and can lower the generated text quality. In this paper, we propose Mention Flags (MF), which trace whether lexical constraints are satisfied in the generated outputs of an S2S decoder. The MF models are trained to generate tokens until all constraints are satisfied, guaranteeing high constraint satisfaction. Our experiments on the Common Sense Generation task (CommonGen) (Lin et al., 2020), End2end Data-to-Text task (E2ENLG) (Dušek et al., 2020) and Novel Object Captioning task (nocaps) (Agrawal et al., 2019) show that the MF models maintain higher constraint satisfaction and text quality than the baseline models and other constrained text generation algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks. These results are achieved with a much lower run-time than constrained decoding algorithms. We also show that the MF models work well in the low-resource setting. 1","{'sequence': 'This paper focuses on Seq2Seq (S2S) constrained text generation where the text generator is constrained to mention specific words, which are inputs to the encoder, in the generated outputs.

Generation,Generalising Multilingual Concept-to-Text NLG with Language Agnostic Delexicalisation,"Concept-to-text Natural Language Generation is the task of expressing an input meaning representation in natural language. Previous approaches in this task have been able to generalise to rare or unseen instances by relying on a delexicalisation of the input. However, this often requires that the input appears verbatim in the output text. This poses challenges in multilingual settings, where the task expands to generate the output text in multiple languages given the same input. In this paper, we explore the application of multilingual models in concept-to-text and propose Language Agnostic Delexicalisation, a novel delexicalisation method that uses multilingual pretrained embeddings, and employs a character-level postediting model to inflect words in their correct form during relexicalisation. Our experiments across five datasets and five languages show that multilingual models outperform monolingual models in concept-to-text and that our framework outperforms previous approaches, especially in low resource conditions.","{'sequence': 'Concept-to-text Natural Language Generation is the task of expressing an input meaning representation in natural language.

Generation,On Training Instance Selection for Few-Shot Neural Text Generation,"Large-scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic improvements in text generation. Impressive performance can be achieved by finetuning only on a small number of instances (few-shot setting). Nonetheless, almost all previous work simply applies random sampling to select the few-shot training instances. Little to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they would affect model performance. In this work, we present a study on training instance selection in few-shot neural text generation. The selection decision is made based only on the unlabeled data so as to identify the most worthwhile data points that should be annotated under some budget of labeling cost. Based on the intuition that the few-shot training instances should be diverse and representative of the entire data distribution, we propose a simple selection strategy with K-means clustering. We show that even with the naive clustering-based approach, the generation models consistently outperform random sampling on three text generation tasks: data-to-text generation, document summarization and question generation. The code and training data are made available at https://gitlab.com/erniecyc/ few-selector. We hope that this work will call for more attention on this largely unexplored area.","{'sequence': 'Large-scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic improvements in text generation.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Conversations Are Not Flat: Modeling the Dynamic Information Flow across Dialogue Utterances,"Nowadays, open-domain dialogue models can generate acceptable responses according to the historical context based on the large-scale pretrained language models. However, they generally concatenate the dialogue history directly as the model input to predict the response, which we named as the flat pattern and ignores the dynamic information flow across dialogue utterances. In this work, we propose the DialoFlow model, in which we introduce a dynamic flow mechanism to model the context flow, and design three training objectives to capture the information dynamics across dialogue utterances by addressing the semantic influence brought about by each utterance in large-scale pre-training. Experiments on the multi-reference Reddit Dataset and DailyDialog Dataset demonstrate that our DialoFlow significantly outperforms the DialoGPT on the dialogue generation task. Besides, we propose the Flow score, an effective automatic metric for evaluating interactive human-bot conversation quality based on the pre-trained DialoFlow, which presents high chatbot-level correlation (r = 0.9) with human ratings among 11 chatbots. Code and pre-trained models will be public. 1","{'sequence': 'Nowadays, open-domain dialogue models can generate acceptable responses according to the historical context based on the large-scale pretrained language models.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dual Slot Selector via Local Reliability Verification for Dialogue State Tracking,"The goal of dialogue state tracking (DST) is to predict the current dialogue state given all previous dialogue contexts. Existing approaches generally predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. However, the overwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot values from the previous turn. Therefore, the mechanism of treating slots equally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional errors because of the redundant slot value generation. To address this problem, we devise the two-stage DSS-DST which consists of the Dual Slot Selector based on the current turn dialogue, and the Slot Value Generator based on the dialogue history. The Dual Slot Selector determines each slot whether to update slot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two aspects: (1) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn dialogue utterances; (2) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained for it through the current turn dialogue. The slots selected to be updated are permitted to enter the Slot Value Generator to update values by a hybrid method, while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous turn. Empirical results show that our method achieves 56.93%, 60.73%, and 58.04% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0, MultiWOZ 2.1, and Multi-WOZ 2.2 datasets respectively and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements. 1","{'sequence': 'The goal of dialogue state tracking (DST) is to predict the current dialogue state given all previous dialogue contexts.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Transferable Dialogue Systems and User Simulators,"One of the difficulties in training dialogue systems is the lack of training data. We explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. Our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents.

With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,BoB: BERT Over BERT for Training Persona-based Dialogue Models from Limited Personalized Data,"Maintaining consistent personas is essential for dialogue agents. Although tremendous advancements have been brought, the limitedscale of annotated persona-dense data are still barriers towards training robust and consistent persona-based dialogue models. In this work, we show how the challenges can be addressed by disentangling persona-based dialogue generation into two sub-tasks with a novel BERTover-BERT (BoB) model. Specifically, the model consists of a BERT-based encoder and two BERT-based decoders, where one decoder is for response generation, and another is for consistency understanding. In particular, to learn the ability of consistency understanding from large-scale non-dialogue inference data, we train the second decoder in an unlikelihood manner. Under different limited data settings, both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines in response quality and persona consistency.","{'sequence': 'Maintaining consistent personas is essential for dialogue agents.

Information Extraction,Accelerating BERT Inference for Sequence Labeling via Early-Exit,"Both performance and efficiency are crucial factors for sequence labeling tasks in many real-world scenarios. Although the pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly improved the performance of various sequence labeling tasks, their computational cost is expensive. To alleviate this problem, we extend the recent successful early-exit mechanism to accelerate the inference of PTMs for sequence labeling tasks. However, existing early-exit mechanisms are specifically designed for sequencelevel tasks, rather than sequence labeling. In this paper, we first propose SENTEE: a simple extension of SENTence-level Early-Exit for sequence labeling tasks. To further reduce computational cost, we also propose TOKEE: a TOKen-level Early-Exit mechanism that allows partial tokens to exit early at different layers. Considering the local dependency inherent in sequence labeling, we employed a window-based criterion to decide for a token whether or not to exit. The token-level earlyexit brings the gap between training and inference, so we introduce an extra self-sampling fine-tuning stage to alleviate it. The extensive experiments on three popular sequence labeling tasks show that our approach can save up to 66%∼75% inference cost with minimal performance degradation.

Moreover, as boundary detection and type prediction may cooperate with each other for the NER task, it is also important for the two subtasks to mutually reinforce each other by sharing their information. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Interaction Network (MIN) model which utilizes both segmentlevel information and word-level dependencies, and incorporates an interaction mechanism to support information sharing between boundary detection and type prediction to enhance the performance for the NER task. We have conducted extensive experiments based on three NER benchmark datasets. The performance results have shown that the proposed MIN model has outperformed the current stateof-the-art models.","{'sequence': 'Although the existing Named Entity Recognition (NER) models have achieved promising performance, they suffer from certain drawbacks.

Information Extraction,Capturing Event Argument Interaction via A Bi-Directional Entity-Level Recurrent Decoder,"Capturing interactions among event arguments is an essential step towards robust event argument extraction (EAE). However, existing efforts in this direction suffer from two limitations: 1) The argument role type information of contextual entities is mainly utilized as training signals, ignoring the potential merits of directly adopting it as semantically rich input features; 2) The argument-level sequential semantics, which implies the overall distribution pattern of argument roles over an event mention, is not well characterized. To tackle the above two bottlenecks, we formalize EAE as a Seq2Seq-like learning problem for the first time, where a sentence with a specific event trigger is mapped to a sequence of event argument roles. A neural architecture with a novel Bi-directional Entity-level Recurrent Decoder (BERD) is proposed to generate argument roles by incorporating contextual entities' argument role predictions, like a wordby-word text generation process, thereby distinguishing implicit argument distribution patterns within an event more accurately.","{'sequence': ""Capturing interactions among event arguments is an essential step towards robust event argument extraction (EAE).

Information Extraction,UniRE: A Unified Label Space for Entity Relation Extraction,"Many joint entity relation extraction models setup two separated label spaces for the two sub-tasks (i.e., entity detection and relation classification). We argue that this setting may hinder the information interaction between entities and relations. In this work, we propose to eliminate the different treatment on the two sub-tasks' label spaces. The input of our model is a table containing all word pairs from a sentence. Entities and relations are represented by squares and rectangles in the table. We apply a unified classifier to predict each cell's label, which unifies the learning of two sub-tasks. For testing, an effective (yet fast) approximate decoder is proposed for finding squares and rectangles from tables. Experiments on three benchmarks (ACE04, ACE05, SciERC) show that, using only half the number of parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy with the best extractor, and is faster.","{'sequence': ""Many joint entity relation extraction models setup two separated label spaces for the two sub-tasks (i.e., entity detection and relation classification).

Information Extraction,Refining Sample Embeddings with Relation Prototypes to Enhance Continual Relation Extraction,"Continual learning has gained increasing attention in recent years, thanks to its biological interpretation and efficiency in many realworld applications. As a typical task of continual learning, continual relation extraction (CRE) aims to extract relations between entities from texts, where the samples of different relations are delivered into the model continuously. Some previous works have proved that storing typical samples of old relations in memory can help the model keep a stable understanding of old relations and avoid forgetting them. However, most methods heavily depend on the memory size in that they simply replay these memorized samples in subsequent tasks. To fully utilize memorized samples, in this paper, we employ relation prototype to extract useful information of each relation. Specifically, the prototype embedding for a specific relation is computed based on memorized samples of this relation, which is collected by K-means algorithm. The prototypes of all observed relations at current learning stage are used to re-initialize a memory network to refine subsequent sample embeddings, which ensures the model's stable understanding on all observed relations when learning a new task. Compared with previous CRE models, our model utilizes the memory information sufficiently and efficiently, resulting in enhanced CRE performance. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art CRE models and has great advantage in avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

However, the computational complexity of a self-attention network is O(n 2 ), increasing quadratically with sequence length. By contrast, the complexity of LSTM-based approaches is only O(n). In practice, however, LSTMs are much slower to train than self-attention networks as they cannot be parallelized at sequence level: to model context, the current LSTM state relies on the full LSTM computation of the preceding state. This has to be computed n times for a sequence of length n. The linear transformations involved in the LSTM gate and state computations are the major cost factors in this. To enable sequence-level parallelization of LSTMs, we approximate full LSTM context modelling by computing hidden states and gates with the current input and a simple bag-of-words representation of the preceding tokens context. This allows us to compute each input step efficiently in parallel, avoiding the formerly costly sequential linear transformations. We then connect the outputs of each parallel step with computationally cheap element-wise computations. We call this the Highly Parallelized LSTM. To further constrain the number of LSTM parameters, we compute several small HPLSTMs in parallel like multi-head attention in the Transformer. The experiments show that our MHPLSTM decoder achieves significant BLEU improvements, while being even slightly faster than the self-attention network in training, and much faster than the standard LSTM.","{'sequence': 'One of the reasons Transformer translation models are popular is that self-attention networks for context modelling can be easily parallelized at sequence level.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Bidirectional Transformer Based Alignment Model for Unsupervised Word Alignment,"Word alignment and machine translation are two closely related tasks. Neural translation models, such as RNN-based and Transformer models, employ a target-to-source attention mechanism which can provide rough word alignments, but with a rather low accuracy. High-quality word alignment can help neural machine translation in many different ways, such as missing word detection, annotation transfer and lexicon injection. Existing methods for learning word alignment include statistical word aligners (e.g. GIZA++) and recently neural word alignment models. This paper presents a bidirectional Transformer based alignment (BTBA) model for unsupervised learning of the word alignment task. Our BTBA model predicts the current target word by attending the source context and both leftside and right-side target context to produce accurate target-to-source attention (alignment). We further fine-tune the target-to-source attention in the BTBA model to obtain better alignments using a full context based optimization method and self-supervised training. We test our method on three word alignment tasks and show that our method outperforms both previous neural word alignment approaches and the popular statistical word aligner GIZA++.","{'sequence': 'Word alignment and machine translation are two closely related tasks.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Multimodal Sentiment Detection Based on Multi-channel Graph Neural Networks,"With the popularity of smartphones, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation of multimodal posts on various social media platforms. We observe that the multimodal sentiment expression has specific global characteristics, such as the interdependencies of objects or scenes within the image. However, most previous studies only considered the representation of a single image-text post and failed to capture the global co-occurrence characteristics of the dataset. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Graph Neural Networks with Sentiment-awareness (MGNNS) for imagetext sentiment detection.

However, most existing work does not examine the actual joke mechanism to understand humor. We break down any joke into two distinct components: the set-up and the punchline, and further explore the special relationship between them. Inspired by the incongruity theory of humor, we model the setup as the part developing semantic uncertainty, and the punchline disrupting audience expectations. With increasingly powerful language models, we were able to feed the set-up along with the punchline into the GPT-2 language model, and calculate the uncertainty and surprisal values of the jokes.

Summarization,PASS: Perturb-and-Select Summarizer for Product Reviews,"The product reviews summarization task aims to automatically produce a short summary for a set of reviews of a given product. Such summaries are expected to aggregate a range of different opinions in a concise, coherent and informative manner. This challenging task gives rise to two shortcomings in existing work. First, summarizers tend to favor generic content that appears in reviews for many different products, resulting in template-like, less informative summaries. Second, as reviewers often disagree on the pros and cons of a given product, summarizers sometimes yield inconsistent, self-contradicting summaries. We propose the PASS system (Perturb-and-Select Summarizer) that employs a large pre-trained Transformer-based model (T5 in our case), which follows a few-shot fine-tuning scheme. A key component of the PASS system relies on applying systematic perturbations to the model's input during inference, which allows it to generate multiple different summaries per product. We develop a method for ranking these summaries according to desired criteria, coherence in our case, enabling our system to almost entirely avoid the problem of selfcontradiction.

In order to address this problem, we innovatively consider the single-document extractive summarization as a rebalance problem and present a deep differential amplifier framework to enhance the features of summary sentences. Specifically, we calculate and amplify the semantic difference between each sentence and other sentences, and apply the residual unit to deepen the differential amplifier architecture. Furthermore, the corresponding objective loss of the minority class is boosted by a weighted cross-entropy. In this way, our model pays more attention to the pivotal information of one sentence, that is different from previous approaches which model all informative context in the source document.

Summarization,Self-Supervised Multimodal Opinion Summarization,"Recently, opinion summarization, which is the generation of a summary from multiple reviews, has been conducted in a self-supervised manner by considering a sampled review as a pseudo summary. However, non-text data such as image and metadata related to reviews have been considered less often. To use the abundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization framework called Mul-timodalSum. Our framework obtains a representation of each modality using a separate encoder for each modality, and the text decoder generates a summary. To resolve the inherent heterogeneity of multimodal data, we propose a multimodal training pipeline. We first pretrain the text encoder-decoder based solely on text modality data. Subsequently, we pretrain the non-text modality encoders by considering the pretrained text decoder as a pivot for the homogeneous representation of multimodal data. Finally, to fuse multimodal representations, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the superiority of MultimodalSum by conducting experiments on Yelp and Amazon datasets.","{'sequence': 'Recently, opinion summarization, which is the generation of a summary from multiple reviews, has been conducted in a self-supervised manner by considering a sampled review as a pseudo summary.

To use the abundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization framework called Mul-timodalSum. Our framework obtains a representation of each modality using a separate encoder for each modality, and the text decoder generates a summary. To resolve the inherent heterogeneity of multimodal data, we propose a multimodal training pipeline. We first pretrain the text encoder-decoder based solely on text modality data. Subsequently, we pretrain the non-text modality encoders by considering the pretrained text decoder as a pivot for the homogeneous representation of multimodal data. Finally, to fuse multimodal representations, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner.

Summarization,A Training-free and Reference-free Summarization Evaluation Metric via Centrality-weighted Relevance and Self-referenced Redundancy,"In recent years, reference-based and supervised summarization evaluation metrics have been widely explored. However, collecting human-annotated references and ratings are costly and time-consuming. To avoid these limitations, we propose a training-free and reference-free summarization evaluation metric. Our metric consists of a centralityweighted relevance score and a self-referenced redundancy score. The relevance score is computed between the pseudo reference built from the source document and the given summary, where the pseudo reference content is weighted by the sentence centrality to provide importance guidance. Besides an F 1 -based relevance score, we also design an F β -based variant that pays more attention to the recall score. As for the redundancy score of the summary, we compute a self-masked similarity score with the summary itself to evaluate the redundant information in the summary. Finally, we combine the relevance and redundancy scores to produce the final evaluation score of the given summary. Extensive experiments show that our methods can significantly outperform existing methods on both multi-document and single-document summarization evaluation.

Summarization,DESCGEN: A Distantly Supervised Datasetfor Generating Entity Descriptions,"Short textual descriptions of entities provide summaries of their key attributes and have been shown to be useful sources of background knowledge for tasks such as entity linking and question answering. However, generating entity descriptions, especially for new and long-tail entities, can be challenging since relevant information is often scattered across multiple sources with varied content and style. We introduce DESCGEN: given mentions spread over multiple documents, the goal is to generate an entity summary description. DESC-GEN consists of 37K entity descriptions from Wikipedia and Fandom, each paired with nine evidence documents on average. The documents were collected using a combination of entity linking and hyperlinks to the Wikipedia and Fandom entity pages, which together provide high quality distant supervision. The resulting summaries are more abstractive than those found in existing datasets, and provide a better proxy for the challenge of describing new and emerging entities. We also propose a two-stage extract-then-generate baseline and show that there exists a large gap (19.9% in ROUGE-L) between state-of-the-art models and human performance, suggesting that the data will support significant future work. 1","{'sequence': 'Short textual descriptions of entities provide summaries of their key attributes and have been shown to be useful sources of background knowledge for tasks such as entity linking and question answering.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Introducing Orthogonal Constraint in Structural Probes,"With the recent success of pre-trained models in NLP, a significant focus was put on interpreting their representations. One of the most prominent approaches is structural probing (Hewitt and Manning, 2019) , where a linear projection of word embeddings is performed in order to approximate the topology of dependency structures. In this work, we introduce a new type of structural probing, where the linear projection is decomposed into 1. isomorphic space rotation; 2. linear scaling that identifies and scales the most relevant dimensions. In addition to syntactic dependency, we evaluate our method on novel tasks (lexical hypernymy and position in a sentence). We jointly train the probes for multiple tasks and experimentally show that lexical and syntactic information is separated in the representations.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Hidden Killer: Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks with Syntactic Trigger,"Backdoor attacks are a kind of insidious security threat against machine learning models. After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim model will produce adversaryspecified outputs on the inputs embedded with predesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As a sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing (NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing textual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples as triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the backdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort. In this paper, we propose to use the syntactic structure as the trigger in textual backdoor attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the syntactic trigger-based attack method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100% success rate) to the insertionbased methods but possesses much higher invisibility and stronger resistance to defenses. These results also reveal the significant insidiousness and harmfulness of textual backdoor attacks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Examining the Inductive Bias of Neural Language Models with Artificial Languages,"Since language models are used to model a wide variety of languages, it is natural to ask whether the neural architectures used for the task have inductive biases towards modeling particular types of languages. Investigation of these biases has proved complicated due to the many variables that appear in the experimental setup. Languages vary in many typological dimensions, and it is difficult to single out one or two to investigate without the others acting as confounders. We propose a novel method for investigating the inductive biases of language models using artificial languages. These languages are constructed to allow us to create parallel corpora across languages that differ only in the typological feature being investigated, such as word order. We then use them to train and test language models. This constitutes a fully controlled causal framework, and demonstrates how grammar engineering can serve as a useful tool for analyzing neural models. Using this method, we find that commonly used neural architectures exhibit different inductive biases: LSTMs display little preference with respect to word ordering, while transformers display a clear preference for some orderings over others. Further, we find that neither the inductive bias of the LSTM nor that of the transformer appears to reflect any tendencies that we see in attested natural languages.","{'sequence': 'Since language models are used to model a wide variety of languages, it is natural to ask whether the neural architectures used for the task have inductive biases towards modeling particular types of languages.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Improving the Faithfulness of Attention-based Explanations with Task-specific Information for Text Classification,"Neural network architectures in natural language processing often use attention mechanisms to produce probability distributions over input token representations. Attention has empirically been demonstrated to improve performance in various tasks, while its weights have been extensively used as explanations for model predictions. Recent studies (Jain and Wallace, 2019; Serrano and Smith, 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019) have showed that it cannot generally be considered as a faithful explanation (Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020) across encoders and tasks. In this paper, we seek to improve the faithfulness of attention-based explanations for text classification. We achieve this by proposing a new family of Task-Scaling (TaSc) mechanisms that learn task-specific non-contextualised information to scale the original attention weights. Evaluation tests for explanation faithfulness, show that the three proposed variants of TaSc improve attentionbased explanations across two attention mechanisms, five encoders and five text classification datasets without sacrificing predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate that TaSc consistently provides more faithful attentionbased explanations compared to three widelyused interpretability techniques. 1","{'sequence': 'Neural network architectures in natural language processing often use attention mechanisms to produce probability distributions over input token representations.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Are VQA Systems RAD? Measuring Robustness to Augmented Data with Focused Interventions,"Deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in visual question answering (VQA) tasks, but a more careful look reveals that they often do not understand the rich signal they are being fed with. To understand and better measure the generalization capabilities of VQA systems, we look at their robustness to counterfactually augmented data. Our proposed augmentations are designed to make a focused intervention on a specific property of the question such that the answer changes. Using these augmentations, we propose a new robustness measure, Robustness to Augmented Data (RAD), which measures the consistency of model predictions between original and augmented examples. Through extensive experimentation, we show that RAD, unlike classical accuracy measures, can quantify when stateof-the-art systems are not robust to counterfactuals. We find substantial failure cases which reveal that current VQA systems are still brittle. Finally, we connect between robustness and generalization, demonstrating the predictive power of RAD for performance on unseen augmentations. 1  Arijit Ray, Karan Sikka, Ajay Divakaran, Stefan Lee, and Giedrius Burachas. 2019.

Machine Learning for NLP,Cascaded Head-colliding Attention,"Transformers have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) in many ways. At the heart of the Transformer architecture is the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism which models pairwise interactions between the elements of the sequence. Despite its massive success, the current framework ignores interactions among different heads, leading to the problem that many of the heads are redundant in practice, which underutilizes the capacity of the model. To improve parameter efficiency, we re-formulate the MHA as a latent variable model from a probabilistic perspective. We present cascaded head-colliding attention (CODA) which explicitly models the interactions between attention heads through a hierarchical variational distribution. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that CODA outperforms the transformer baseline, by 0.6 perplexity on Wikitext-103 in language modeling, and by 0.6 BLEU on WMT14 EN-DE in machine translation, due to its improvements on the parameter efficiency. 1","{'sequence': 'Transformers have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) in many ways.

Machine Learning for NLP,Structural Knowledge Distillation: Tractably Distilling Information for Structured Predictor,"Knowledge distillation is a critical technique to transfer knowledge between models, typically from a large model (the teacher) to a more fine-grained one (the student). The objective function of knowledge distillation is typically the cross-entropy between the teacher and the student's output distributions. However, for structured prediction problems, the output space is exponential in size; therefore, the cross-entropy objective becomes intractable to compute and optimize directly. In this paper, we derive a factorized form of the knowledge distillation objective for structured prediction, which is tractable for many typical choices of the teacher and student models. In particular, we show the tractability and empirical effectiveness of structural knowledge distillation between sequence labeling and dependency parsing models under four different scenarios: 1) the teacher and student share the same factorization form of the output structure scoring function; 2) the student factorization produces more fine-grained substructures than the teacher factorization; 3) the teacher factorization produces more fine-grained substructures than the student factorization; 4) the factorization forms from the teacher and the student are incompatible. 1","{'sequence': ""Knowledge distillation is a critical technique to transfer knowledge between models, typically from a large model (the teacher) to a more fine-grained one (the student).

This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters.

Machine Learning for NLP,COSY: COunterfactual SYntax for Cross-Lingual Understanding,"Pre-trained multilingual language models, e.g., multilingual-BERT, are widely used in crosslingual tasks, yielding the state-of-the-art performance. However, such models suffer from a large performance gap between source and target languages, especially in the zero-shot setting, where the models are fine-tuned only on English but tested on other languages for the same task. We tackle this issue by incorporating language-agnostic information, specifically, universal syntax such as dependency relations and POS tags, into language models, based on the observation that universal syntax is transferable across different languages. Our approach, named COunterfactual SYntax (COSY), includes the design of SYntaxaware networks as well as a COunterfactual training method to implicitly force the networks to learn not only the semantics but also the syntax. To evaluate COSY, we conduct cross-lingual experiments on natural language inference and question answering using mBERT and XLM-R as network backbones.

Machine Learning for NLP,How Helpful is Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Table-to-Text Generation?,"Existing approaches for the Table-to-Text task suffer from issues such as missing information, hallucination and repetition. Many approaches to this problem use Reinforcement Learning (RL), which maximizes a single manually defined reward, such as BLEU. In this work, we instead pose the Table-to-Text task as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Understanding and Countering Stereotypes: A Computational Approach to the Stereotype Content Model,"Stereotypical language expresses widely-held beliefs about different social categories. Many stereotypes are overtly negative, while others may appear positive on the surface, but still lead to negative consequences. In this work, we present a computational approach to interpreting stereotypes in text through the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a comprehensive causal theory from social psychology. The SCM proposes that stereotypes can be understood along two primary dimensions: warmth and competence. We present a method for defining warmth and competence axes in semantic embedding space, and show that the four quadrants defined by this subspace accurately represent the warmth and competence concepts, according to annotated lexicons. We then apply our computational SCM model to textual stereotype data and show that it compares favourably with survey-based studies in the psychological literature. Furthermore, we explore various strategies to counter stereotypical beliefs with anti-stereotypes. It is known that countering stereotypes with antistereotypical examples is one of the most effective ways to reduce biased thinking, yet the problem of generating anti-stereotypes has not been previously studied. Thus, a better understanding of how to generate realistic and effective anti-stereotypes can contribute to addressing pressing societal concerns of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.","{'sequence': 'Stereotypical language expresses widely-held beliefs about different social categories.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Structurizing Misinformation Stories via Rationalizing Fact-Checks,"Misinformation has recently become a welldocumented matter of public concern. Existing studies on this topic have hitherto adopted a coarse concept of misinformation, which incorporates a broad spectrum of story types ranging from political conspiracies to misinterpreted pranks. This paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. Our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type(s) (e.g., doctored images, urban legends) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check (e.g., false). We experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales, and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. Using archived fact-checks from Snopes.com, we identify ten types of misinformation stories. We discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 US presidential elections and the H1N1/COVID-19 pandemics.","{'sequence': 'Misinformation has recently become a welldocumented matter of public concern.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Breaking Down the Invisible Wall of Informal Fallacies in Online Discussions,"People debate on a variety of topics on online platforms such as Reddit, or Facebook. Debates can be lengthy, with users exchanging a wealth of information and opinions. However, conversations do not always go smoothly, and users sometimes engage in unsound argumentation techniques to prove a claim. These techniques are called fallacies. Fallacies are persuasive arguments that provide insufficient or incorrect evidence to support the claim. In this paper, we study the most frequent fallacies on Reddit, and we present them using the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation. We construct a new annotated dataset of fallacies, using user comments containing fallacy mentions as noisy labels, and cleaning the data via crowdsourcing. Finally, we study the task of classifying fallacies using neural models.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,SocAoG: Incremental Graph Parsing for Social Relation Inference in Dialogues,"Inferring social relations from dialogues is vital for building emotionally intelligent robots to interpret human language better and act accordingly. We model the social network as an And-or Graph, named SocAoG, for the consistency of relations among a group and leveraging attributes as inference cues. Moreover, we formulate a sequential structure prediction task, and propose an α-β-γ strategy to incrementally parse SocAoG for the dynamic inference upon any incoming utterance: (i) an α process predicting attributes and relations conditioned on the semantics of dialogues, (ii) a β process updating the social relations based on related attributes, and (iii) a γ process updating individual's attributes based on interpersonal social relations. Empirical results on Di-alogRE and MovieGraph show that our model infers social relations more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study shows the three processes complement each other, and the case study demonstrates the dynamic relational inference. 1 1 The code is released at https://github.com/ Liang-Qiu/SocAoG-dialogues.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"TicketTalk: Toward human-level performance with end-to-end, transaction-based dialog systems","We present a data-driven, end-to-end approach to transaction-based dialog systems that performs at near-human levels in terms of verbal response quality and factual grounding accuracy. We show that two essential components of the system produce these results: a sufficiently large and diverse, in-domain labeled dataset, and a neural network-based, pretrained model that generates both verbal responses and API call predictions. In terms of data, we introduce TicketTalk, a movie ticketing dialog dataset with 23,789 annotated conversations. The movie ticketing conversations range from completely open-ended and unrestricted to more structured, both in terms of their knowledge base, discourse features, and number of turns. In qualitative human evaluations, model-generated responses trained on just 10,000 TicketTalk dialogs were rated to ""make sense"" 86.5% of the time, almost the same as human responses in the same contexts. Our simple, API-focused annotation schema results in a much easier labeling task making it faster and more cost effective. It is also the key component for being able to predict API calls accurately. We handle factual grounding by incorporating API calls in the training data, allowing our model to learn which actions to take and when. Trained on the same 10,000-dialog set, the model's API call predictions were rated to be correct 93.9% of the time in our evaluations, surpassing the ratings for the corresponding human labels. We show how API prediction and response generation scores improve as the dataset size incrementally increases from 5000 to 21,000 dialogs. Our analysis also clearly illustrates the benefits of pre-training.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Improving Dialog Systems for Negotiation with Personality Modeling,"In this paper, we explore the ability to model and infer personality types of opponents, predict their responses, and use this information to adapt a dialog agent's high-level strategy in negotiation tasks. Inspired by the idea of incorporating a theory of mind (ToM) into machines, we introduce a probabilistic formulation to encapsulate the opponent's personality type during both learning and inference. We test our approach on the CRAIGSLISTBAR-GAIN dataset (He et al., 2018) and show that our method using ToM inference achieves a 20% higher dialog agreement rate compared to baselines on a mixed population of opponents.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning from Perturbations: Diverse and Informative Dialogue Generation with Inverse Adversarial Training,"In this paper, we propose Inverse Adversarial Training (IAT) algorithm for training neural dialogue systems to avoid generic responses and model dialogue history better. In contrast to standard adversarial training algorithms, IAT encourages the model to be sensitive to the perturbation in the dialogue history and therefore learning from perturbations. By giving higher rewards for responses whose output probability reduces more significantly when dialogue history is perturbed, the model is encouraged to generate more diverse and consistent responses. By penalizing the model when generating the same response given perturbed dialogue history, the model is forced to better capture dialogue history and generate more informative responses. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach can better model dialogue history and generate more diverse and consistent responses. In addition, we point out a problem of the widely used maximum mutual information (MMI) based methods for improving the diversity of dialogue response generation models and demonstrate it empirically.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we propose Inverse Adversarial Training (IAT) algorithm for training neural dialogue systems to avoid generic responses and model dialogue history better.

We propose different evaluation measures to disentangle these different styles of responses by quantifying the informativeness and objectivity. At training time, additional inputs based on these evaluation measures are given to the dialogue model. At generation time, these additional inputs act as stylistic controls that encourage the model to generate responses that are faithful to the provided evidence.

Such customized responses provide paraphrasing ability and contextualization as well as improve the interaction with the user and reduce dialogue monotonicity.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,N-Best ASR Transformer: Enhancing SLU Performance using Multiple ASR Hypotheses,"Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems parse speech into semantic structures like dialog acts and slots. This involves the use of an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) to transcribe speech into multiple text alternatives (hypotheses). Transcription errors, common in ASRs, impact downstream SLU performance negatively. Approaches to mitigate such errors involve using richer information from the ASR, either in form of N-best hypotheses or word-lattices. We hypothesize that transformer models learn better with a simpler utterance representation using the concatenation of the N-best ASR alternatives, where each alternative is separated by a special delimiter [SEP]. In our work, we test our hypothesis by using concatenated N-best ASR alternatives as the input to transformer encoder models, namely BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, and achieve performance equivalent to the prior state-of-the-art model on DSTC2 dataset.

Information Extraction,CitationIE: Leveraging the Citation Graph for Scientific Information Extraction,"Automatically extracting key information from scientific documents has the potential to help scientists work more efficiently and accelerate the pace of scientific progress.

Despite the importance of this task, most existing works on scientific information extraction (SciIE) consider extraction solely based on the content of an individual paper, without considering the paper's place in the broader literature. In contrast to prior work, we augment our text representations by leveraging a complementary source of document context: the citation graph of referential links between citing and cited papers. On a test set of English-language scientific documents, we show that simple ways of utilizing the structure and content of the citation graph can each lead to significant gains in different scientific information extraction tasks.

Information Extraction,From Discourse to Narrative: Knowledge Projection for Event Relation Extraction,"Current event-centric knowledge graphs highly rely on explicit connectives to mine relations between events. Unfortunately, due to the sparsity of connectives, these methods severely undermine the coverage of EventKGs. The lack of high-quality labelled corpora further exacerbates that problem. In this paper, we propose a knowledge projection paradigm for event relation extraction: projecting discourse knowledge to narratives by exploiting the commonalities between them. Specifically, we propose Multi-tier Knowledge Projection Network (MKPNet), which can leverage multitier discourse knowledge effectively for event relation extraction.In this way, the labelled data requirement is significantly reduced, and implicit event relations can be effectively extracted. Intrinsic experimental results show that MKPNet achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, and extrinsic experimental results verify the value of the extracted event relations.","{'sequence': 'Current event-centric knowledge graphs highly rely on explicit connectives to mine relations between events.

Information Extraction,AdvPicker: Effectively Leveraging Unlabeled Data via Adversarial Discriminator for Cross-Lingual NER,"Neural methods have been shown to achieve high performance in Named Entity Recognition (NER), but rely on costly high-quality labeled data for training, which is not always available across languages. While previous works have shown that unlabeled data in a target language can be used to improve crosslingual model performance, we propose a novel adversarial approach (AdvPicker) to better leverage such data and further improve results. We design an adversarial learning framework in which an encoder learns entity domain knowledge from labeled source-language data and better shared features are captured via adversarial training -where a discriminator selects less language-dependent target-language data via similarity to the source language. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets well demonstrate that the proposed method benefits strongly from this data selection process and outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods; without requiring any additional external resources (e.g., gazetteers or via machine translation). 1","{'sequence': 'Neural methods have been shown to achieve high performance in Named Entity Recognition (NER), but rely on costly high-quality labeled data for training, which is not always available across languages.

Information Extraction,Compare to The Knowledge: Graph Neural Fake News Detection with External Knowledge,"Nowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important. Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a directed heterogeneous document graph for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed entity comparison network, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features are fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","{'sequence': 'Nowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important.

Information Extraction,Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition as Maximal Clique Discovery,"Named entity recognition (NER) remains challenging when entity mentions can be discontinuous. Existing methods break the recognition process into several sequential steps. In training, they predict conditioned on the golden intermediate results, while at inference relying on the model output of the previous steps, which introduces exposure bias. To solve this problem, we first construct a segment graph for each sentence, in which each node denotes a segment (a continuous entity on its own, or a part of discontinuous entities), and an edge links two nodes that belong to the same entity. The nodes and edges can be generated respectively in one stage with a grid tagging scheme and learned jointly using a novel architecture named Mac. Then discontinuous NER can be reformulated as a non-parametric process of discovering maximal cliques in the graph and concatenating the spans in each clique. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art (SOTA) results, with up to 3.5 percentage points improvement on F1, and achieves 5x speedup over the SOTA model. 1","{'sequence': 'Named entity recognition (NER) remains challenging when entity mentions can be discontinuous.

Even though constrained to using rules, LNN-EL performs competitively against SotA black-box neural approaches, with the added benefits of extensibility and transferability. In particular, we show that we can easily blend existing rule templates given by a human expert, with multiple types of features (priors, BERT encodings, box embeddings, etc), and even scores resulting from previous EL methods, thus improving on such methods. For instance, on the LC-QuAD-1.0 dataset, we show more than 4% increase in F1 score over previous SotA.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data,"The scarcity of parallel data is a major obstacle for training high-quality machine translation systems for low-resource languages.

In this work, we exploit this linguistic overlap to facilitate translating to and from a lowresource language with only monolingual data, in addition to any parallel data in the related high-resource language. Our method, NMT-Adapt, combines denoising autoencoding, back-translation and adversarial objectives to utilize monolingual data for lowresource adaptation.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Bilingual Lexicon Induction via Unsupervised Bitext Construction and Word Alignment,"Bilingual lexicons map words in one language to their translations in another, and are typically induced by learning linear projections to align monolingual word embedding spaces. In this paper, we show it is possible to produce much higher quality lexicons with methods that combine (1) unsupervised bitext mining and (2) unsupervised word alignment. Directly applying a pipeline that uses recent algorithms for both subproblems significantly improves induced lexicon quality and further gains are possible by learning to filter the resulting lexical entries, with both unsupervised and semisupervised schemes. Our final model outperforms the state of the art on the BUCC 2020 shared task by 14 F 1 points averaged over 12 language pairs, while also providing a more interpretable approach that allows for rich reasoning of word meaning in context. Further analysis of our output and the standard reference lexicons suggests they are of comparable quality, and new benchmarks may be needed to measure further progress on this task. 1","{'sequence': 'Bilingual lexicons map words in one language to their translations in another, and are typically induced by learning linear projections to align monolingual word embedding spaces.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Multilingual Speech Translation from Efficient Finetuning of Pretrained Models,"We present a simple yet effective approach to build multilingual speech-to-text (ST) translation through efficient transfer learning from a pretrained speech encoder and text decoder. Our key finding is that a minimalistic LNA (LayerNorm and Attention) finetuning can achieve zero-shot crosslingual and crossmodality transfer ability by only finetuning 10 ∼ 50% of the pretrained parameters. This effectively leverages large pretrained models at low training cost such as wav2vec 2.0 for acoustic modeling, and mBART for multilingual text generation. This sets a new state-ofthe-art for 36 translation directions (and surpassing cascaded ST for 30 of them) on the large-scale multilingual ST benchmark CoV-oST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b) (+6.4 BLEU on average for En-X directions and +6.7 BLEU for X-En directions). Our approach demonstrates strong zero-shot performance in a many-to-many multilingual model (+5.6 BLEU on average across 28 directions), making it an appealing approach for attaining highquality speech translation with improved parameter and data efficiency.","{'sequence': 'We present a simple yet effective approach to build multilingual speech-to-text (ST) translation through efficient transfer learning from a pretrained speech encoder and text decoder.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Integrated Directional Gradients: Feature Interaction Attribution for Neural NLP Models,"In this paper, we introduce Integrated Directional Gradients (IDG), a method for attributing importance scores to groups of features, indicating their relevance to the output of a neural network model for a given input. The success of Deep Neural Networks has been attributed to their ability to capture higher level feature interactions. Hence, in the last few years capturing the importance of these feature interactions has received increased prominence in ML interpretability literature. In this paper, we formally define the feature group attribution problem and outline a set of axioms that any intuitive feature group attribution method should satisfy. Earlier, cooperative game theory inspired axiomatic methods only borrowed axioms from solution concepts (such as Shapley value) for individual feature attributions and introduced their own extensions to model interactions. In contrast, our formulation is inspired by axioms satisfied by characteristic functions as well as solution concepts in cooperative game theory literature. We believe that characteristic functions are much better suited to model importance of groups compared to just solution concepts. We demonstrate that our proposed method, IDG, satisfies all the axioms. Using IDG we analyze two state-of-the-art text classifiers on three benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis. Our experiments show that IDG is able to effectively capture semantic interactions in linguistic models via negations and conjunctions.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we introduce Integrated Directional Gradients (IDG), a method for attributing importance scores to groups of features, indicating their relevance to the output of a neural network model for a given input.

We believe that characteristic functions are much better suited to model importance of groups compared to just solution concepts. We demonstrate that our proposed method, IDG, satisfies all the axioms. Using IDG we analyze two state-of-the-art text classifiers on three benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis. Our experiments show that IDG is able to effectively capture semantic interactions in linguistic models via negations and conjunctions.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation'], 'scores': [0.09934774041175842, 0.06596507132053375, 0.06348979473114014, 0.060058239847421646, 0.05741266906261444, 0.053414490073919296, 0.0510452464222908, 0.04929704964160919, 0.048908740282058716, 0.045791760087013245, 0.045776061713695526, 0.04067187011241913, 0.04022670537233353, 0.03695892542600632, 0.035036928951740265, 0.032747674733400345, 0.03199080750346184, 0.029153263196349144, 0.028551286086440086, 0.025451356545090675, 0.024780092760920525, 0.018309734761714935, 0.015614568255841732]}",0.09934774041175842,Question Answering,0.03199080750346184
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Is Sparse Attention more Interpretable?,"Sparse attention has been claimed to increase model interpretability under the assumption that it highlights influential inputs. Yet the attention distribution is typically over representations internal to the model rather than the inputs themselves, suggesting this assumption may not have merit. We build on the recent work exploring the interpretability of attention; we design a set of experiments to help us understand how sparsity affects our ability to use attention as an explainability tool. On three text classification tasks, we verify that only a weak relationship between inputs and co-indexed intermediate representations exists-under sparse attention and otherwise. Further, we do not find any plausible mappings from sparse attention distributions to a sparse set of influential inputs through other avenues. Rather, we observe in this setting that inducing sparsity may make it less plausible that attention can be used as a tool for understanding model behavior.","{'sequence': 'Sparse attention has been claimed to increase model interpretability under the assumption that it highlights influential inputs.

Specifically, we consider three types of relevant tasks, including AMR parsing, AMR-to-text generation, and machine translation. We hope that knowledge gained while learning for English AMR parsing and text generation can be transferred to the counterparts of other languages.

SPANBASEDSP extends Pasupat et al.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Enforcing Consistency in Weakly Supervised Semantic Parsing,"The predominant challenge in weakly supervised semantic parsing is that of spurious programs that evaluate to correct answers for the wrong reasons. Prior work uses elaborate search strategies to mitigate the prevalence of spurious programs; however, they typically consider only one input at a time. In this work we explore the use of consistency between the output programs for related inputs to reduce the impact of spurious programs. We bias the program search (and thus the model's training signal) towards programs that map the same phrase in related inputs to the same sub-parts in their respective programs. Additionally, we study the importance of designing logical formalisms that facilitate this kind of consistencybased training. We find that a more consistent formalism leads to improved model performance even without consistency-based training. When combined together, these two insights lead to a 10% absolute improvement over the best prior result on the Natural Language Visual Reasoning dataset.","{'sequence': ""The predominant challenge in weakly supervised semantic parsing is that of spurious programs that evaluate to correct answers for the wrong reasons.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Compositional Generalization and Natural Language Variation: Can a Semantic Parsing Approach Handle Both?,"Sequence-to-sequence models excel at handling natural language variation, but have been shown to struggle with out-of-distribution compositional generalization. This has motivated new specialized architectures with stronger compositional biases, but most of these approaches have only been evaluated on synthetically-generated datasets, which are not representative of natural language variation. In this work we ask: can we develop a semantic parsing approach that handles both natural language variation and compositional generalization? To better assess this capability, we propose new train and test splits of non-synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that strong existing approaches do not perform well across a broad set of evaluations.

Each task is run twice, once with and once without POS tags, on otherwise identical data from ten well-described languages and five underdocumented languages. We find that the presence or absence of POS tags does not have a significant bearing on the performance of either task. In joint segmentation and glossing, the largest average difference is an .09 improvement in F 1 -scores by removing POS tags. In reinflection, the greatest average difference is 1.2% in accuracy for published data and 5% for unpublished data.

Speech and Multimodality,Prosodic segmentation for parsing spoken dialogue,"Parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties, including disfluencies and unmarked boundaries between sentence-like units. Previous work has shown that prosody can help with parsing disfluent speech (Tran et al., 2018) , but has assumed that the input to the parser is already segmented into sentence-like units (SUs), which isn't true in existing speech applications. We investigate how prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a turn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SUbased model). In experiments on the English Switchboard corpus, we find that when using transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs, leading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody can effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the turn-based model performs as well as the SUbased model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1 score, respectively), despite performing two tasks (SU segmentation and parsing) rather than one (parsing alone). Analysis shows that pitch and intensity features are the most important for this corpus, since they allow the model to correctly distinguish an SU boundary from a speech disfluency -a distinction that the model otherwise struggles to make.","{'sequence': ""Parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties, including disfluencies and unmarked boundaries between sentence-like units.

Analysis shows that pitch and intensity features are the most important for this corpus, since they allow the model to correctly distinguish an SU boundary from a speech disfluency -a distinction that the model otherwise struggles to make."", 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10727902501821518, 0.07545387744903564, 0.07136919349431992, 0.0622924342751503, 0.057841796427965164, 0.05746795982122421, 0.04564327001571655, 0.045396409928798676, 0.04474388435482979, 0.04459270462393761, 0.04358157142996788, 0.03937024250626564, 0.035074908286333084, 0.03479596972465515, 0.03309144452214241, 0.030472084879875183, 0.029574153944849968, 0.028479887172579765, 0.0256136916577816, 0.024783214554190636, 0.02438996732234955, 0.022482408210635185, 0.016209840774536133]}",0.10727902501821518,Speech and Multimodality,0.10727902501821518

We utilize the latent representations of pre-trained transformers and propose a simple yet effective method to transform features across all layers to construct outof-domain detectors efficiently. Two domainspecific fine-tuning approaches are further proposed to boost detection accuracy.

Our empirical evaluations of related methods on two datasets validate that our method greatly improves out-of-domain detection ability in a more general scenario. 1', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining'], 'scores': [0.13133542239665985, 0.10136975347995758, 0.06953208148479462, 0.06788553297519684, 0.06548907607793808, 0.05696581304073334, 0.04847485199570656, 0.04548019543290138, 0.03890259191393852, 0.037144094705581665, 0.03673836961388588, 0.03610267490148544, 0.03607784956693649, 0.03549712523818016, 0.02651221491396427, 0.025352373719215393, 0.02497991733253002, 0.02387431636452675, 0.019419053569436073, 0.01913563348352909, 0.01879354566335678, 0.01750294864177704, 0.01743451878428459]}",0.13133542239665985,Resources and Evaluation,0.037144094705581665
Machine Learning for NLP,Continual Quality Estimation with Online Bayesian Meta-Learning,"Most current quality estimation (QE) models for machine translation are trained and evaluated in a static setting where training and test data are assumed to be from a fixed distribution. However, in real-life settings, the test data that a deployed QE model would be exposed to may differ from its training data. In particular, training samples are often labelled by one or a small set of annotators, whose perceptions of translation quality and needs may differ substantially from those of endusers, who will employ predictions in practice. To address this challenge, we propose an online Bayesian meta-learning framework for the continuous training of QE models that is able to adapt them to the needs of different users, while being robust to distributional shifts in training and test data.

Machine Learning for NLP,Selecting Informative Contexts Improves Language Model Fine-tuning,"Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and timeconsuming. Further, the effectiveness of finetuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a validation metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, finetuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard finetuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning -we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.","{'sequence': 'Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and timeconsuming.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,When Do You Need Billions of Words of Pretraining Data?,"NLP is currently dominated by language models like RoBERTa which are pretrained on billions of words. But what exact knowledge or skills do Transformer LMs learn from large-scale pretraining that they cannot learn from less data? To explore this question, we adopt five styles of evaluation: classifier probing, information-theoretic probing, unsupervised relative acceptability judgments, unsupervised language model knowledge probing, and fine-tuning on NLU tasks. We then draw learning curves that track the growth of these different measures of model ability with respect to pretraining data volume using the MiniBERTas, a group of RoBERTa models pretrained on 1M, 10M, 100M and 1B words. We find that these LMs require only about 10M to 100M words to learn to reliably encode most syntactic and semantic features we test. They need a much larger quantity of data in order to acquire enough commonsense knowledge and other skills required to master typical downstream NLU tasks. The results suggest that, while the ability to encode linguistic features is almost certainly necessary for language understanding, it is likely that other, unidentified, forms of knowledge are the major drivers of recent improvements in language understanding among large pretrained models.","{'sequence': 'NLP is currently dominated by language models like RoBERTa which are pretrained on billions of words.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation,"In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature. 1","{'sequence': ""In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence.

We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature. 1"", 'labels': ['Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.26157426834106445, 0.0781630203127861, 0.06153573840856552, 0.05899358168244362, 0.050590116530656815, 0.04982893913984299, 0.03753844276070595, 0.03584762662649155, 0.034800589084625244, 0.03398654982447624, 0.03368788957595825, 0.03204621374607086, 0.02895444631576538, 0.02867341786623001, 0.026126790791749954, 0.023472396656870842, 0.022327307611703873, 0.020311469212174416, 0.019560957327485085, 0.019273223355412483, 0.01880195364356041, 0.01353477593511343, 0.01037033274769783]}",0.26157426834106445,Generation,0.06153573840856552
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Comparing Test Sets with Item Response Theory,"Recent years have seen numerous NLP datasets introduced to evaluate the performance of fine-tuned models on natural language understanding tasks. Recent results from large pretrained models, though, show that many of these datasets are largely saturated and unlikely to be able to detect further progress. What kind of datasets are still effective at discriminating among strong models, and what kind of datasets should we expect to be able to detect future improvements? To measure this uniformly across datasets, we draw on Item Response Theory and evaluate 29 datasets using predictions from 18 pretrained Transformer models on individual test examples. We find that Quoref, Hel-laSwag, and MC-TACO are best suited for distinguishing among state-of-the-art models, while SNLI, MNLI, and CommitmentBank seem to be saturated for current strong models. We also observe span selection task format, which is used for QA datasets like QAMR or SQuAD2.0, is effective in differentiating between strong and weak models.","{'sequence': 'Recent years have seen numerous NLP datasets introduced to evaluate the performance of fine-tuned models on natural language understanding tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Uncovering Constraint-Based Behavior in Neural Models via Targeted Fine-Tuning,"A growing body of literature has focused on detailing the linguistic knowledge embedded in large, pretrained language models. Existing work has shown that non-linguistic biases in models can drive model behavior away from linguistic generalizations. We hypothesized that competing linguistic processes within a language, rather than just non-linguistic model biases, could obscure underlying linguistic knowledge. We tested this claim by exploring a single phenomenon in four languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, and Italian. While human behavior has been found to be similar across languages, we find cross-linguistic variation in model behavior. We show that competing processes in a language act as constraints on model behavior and demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning can re-weight the learned constraints, uncovering otherwise dormant linguistic knowledge in models. Our results suggest that models need to learn both the linguistic constraints in a language and their relative ranking, with mismatches in either producing non-human-like behavior.","{'sequence': 'A growing body of literature has focused on detailing the linguistic knowledge embedded in large, pretrained language models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,More Identifiable yet Equally Performant Transformers for Text Classification,"Interpretability is an important aspect of the trustworthiness of a model's predictions. Transformer's predictions are widely explained by the attention weights, i.e., a probability distribution generated at its self-attention unit (head). Current empirical studies provide shreds of evidence that attention weights are not explanations by proving that they are not unique. A recent study showed theoretical justifications to this observation by proving the non-identifiability of attention weights. For a given input to a head and its output, if the attention weights generated in it are unique, we call the weights identifiable. In this work, we provide deeper theoretical analysis and empirical observations on the identifiability of attention weights. Ignored in the previous works, we find the attention weights are more identifiable than we currently perceive by uncovering the hidden role of the key vector. However, the weights are still prone to be non-unique attentions that make them unfit for interpretation. To tackle this issue, we provide a variant of the encoder layer that decouples the relationship between key and value vector and provides identifiable weights up to the desired length of the input. We prove the applicability of such variations by providing empirical justifications on varied text classification tasks.

Resources and Evaluation,A Dataset and Baselines for Multilingual Reply Suggestion,"Reply suggestion models help users process emails and chats faster. Previous work only studies English reply suggestion. Instead, we present MRS, a multilingual reply suggestion dataset with ten languages. MRS can be used to compare two families of models: 1) retrieval models that select the reply from a fixed set and 2) generation models that produce the reply from scratch. Therefore, MRS complements existing cross-lingual generalization benchmarks that focus on classification and sequence labeling tasks. We build a generation model and a retrieval model as baselines for MRS. The two models have different strengths in the monolingual setting, and they require different strategies to generalize across languages. MRS is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangmozhi/mrs. Multilingual Reply Suggestion Automated reply suggestion is a useful feature for email and chat applications. Given an input message, the system suggests several replies, and users may click on them to save typing time (Figure 1 ).

Previous work only studies English reply suggestion. Instead, we present MRS, a multilingual reply suggestion dataset with ten languages. MRS can be used to compare two families of models: 1) retrieval models that select the reply from a fixed set and 2) generation models that produce the reply from scratch. Therefore, MRS complements existing cross-lingual generalization benchmarks that focus on classification and sequence labeling tasks. We build a generation model and a retrieval model as baselines for MRS. The two models have different strengths in the monolingual setting, and they require different strategies to generalize across languages. MRS is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangmozhi/mrs. Multilingual Reply Suggestion Automated reply suggestion is a useful feature for email and chat applications.

Resources and Evaluation,What Ingredients Make for an Effective Crowdsourcing Protocol for Difficult NLU Data Collection Tasks?,"Crowdsourcing is widely used to create data for common natural language understanding tasks. Despite the importance of these datasets for measuring and refining model understanding of language, there has been little focus on the crowdsourcing methods used for collecting the datasets. In this paper, we compare the efficacy of interventions that have been proposed in prior work as ways of improving data quality. We use multiple-choice question answering as a testbed and run a randomized trial by assigning crowdworkers to write questions under one of four different data collection protocols. We find that asking workers to write explanations for their examples is an ineffective stand-alone strategy for boosting NLU example difficulty. However, we find that training crowdworkers, and then using an iterative process of collecting data, sending feedback, and qualifying workers based on expert judgments is an effective means of collecting challenging data. But using crowdsourced, instead of expert judgments, to qualify workers and send feedback does not prove to be effective. We observe that the data from the iterative protocol with expert assessments is more challenging by several measures. Notably, the humanmodel gap on the unanimous agreement portion of this data is, on average, twice as large as the gap for the baseline protocol data.","{'sequence': 'Crowdsourcing is widely used to create data for common natural language understanding tasks.

In practice, we construct a heterogeneous graph for the legislative context and use relational graph neural networks to learn the representation of legislators with the guidance of historical records of their voting and hashtag usage.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Measure and Evaluation of Semantic Divergence across Two Languages,"Languages are dynamic systems: word usage may change over time, reflecting various societal factors. However, all languages do not evolve identically: the impact of an event, the influence of a trend or thinking, can differ between communities. In this paper, we propose to track these divergences by comparing the evolution of a word and its translation across two languages. We investigate several methods of building time-varying and bilingual word embeddings, using contextualised and non-contextualised embeddings. We propose a set of scenarios to characterize semantic divergence across two languages, along with a setup to differentiate them in a bilingual corpus. We evaluate the different methods by generating a corpus of synthetic semantic change across two languages, English and French, before applying them to newspaper corpora to detect bilingual semantic divergence and provide qualitative insight for the task. We conclude that BERT embeddings coupled with a clustering step lead to the best performance on synthetic corpora; however, the performance of CBOW embeddings is very competitive and more adapted to an exploratory analysis on a large corpus.","{'sequence': 'Languages are dynamic systems: word usage may change over time, reflecting various societal factors.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Improving Zero-Shot Translation by Disentangling Positional Information,"Multilingual neural machine translation has shown the capability of directly translating between language pairs unseen in training, i.e. zero-shot translation. Despite being conceptually attractive, it often suffers from low output quality. The difficulty of generalizing to new translation directions suggests the model representations are highly specific to those language pairs seen in training. We demonstrate that a main factor causing the language-specific representations is the positional correspondence to input tokens. We show that this can be easily alleviated by removing residual connections in an encoder layer. With this modification, we gain up to 18.5 BLEU points on zero-shot translation while retaining quality on supervised directions. The improvements are particularly prominent between related languages, where our proposed model outperforms pivot-based translation. Moreover, our approach allows easy integration of new languages, which substantially expands translation coverage. By thorough inspections of the hidden layer outputs, we show that our approach indeed leads to more languageindependent representations. 1","{'sequence': 'Multilingual neural machine translation has shown the capability of directly translating between language pairs unseen in training, i.e. zero-shot translation.

By thorough inspections of the hidden layer outputs, we show that our approach indeed leads to more languageindependent representations. 1', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.4292523264884949, 0.04900653287768364, 0.04328478127717972, 0.04131783917546272, 0.036100033670663834, 0.034551072865724564, 0.03117425926029682, 0.02821068838238716, 0.026989417150616646, 0.02479156106710434, 0.02431866154074669, 0.02334727719426155, 0.022914143279194832, 0.02233351580798626, 0.022009961307048798, 0.0213740486651659, 0.021248431876301765, 0.021176673471927643, 0.019771583378314972, 0.018579600378870964, 0.01502882968634367, 0.012820644304156303, 0.01039811596274376]}",0.4292523264884949,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.4292523264884949
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Common Sense Beyond English: Evaluating and Improving Multilingual Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning,"Commonsense reasoning research has so far been limited to English. We aim to evaluate and improve popular multilingual language models (ML-LMs) to help advance commonsense reasoning (CSR) beyond English. We collect the Mickey corpus, consisting of 561k sentences in 11 different languages, which can be used for analyzing and improving ML-LMs. We propose Mickey Probe, a languageagnostic probing task for fairly evaluating the common sense of popular ML-LMs across different languages. In addition, we also create two new datasets, X-CSQA and X-CODAH, by translating their English versions to 15 other languages, so that we can evaluate popular ML-LMs for cross-lingual commonsense reasoning. To improve the performance beyond English, we propose a simple yet effective method -multilingual contrastive pretraining (MCP).

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Attention Calibration for Transformer in Neural Machine Translation,"Attention mechanisms have achieved substantial improvements in neural machine translation by dynamically selecting relevant inputs for different predictions. However, recent studies have questioned the attention mechanisms' capability for discovering decisive inputs. In this paper, we propose to calibrate the attention weights by introducing a mask perturbation model that automatically evaluates each input's contribution to the model outputs. We increase the attention weights assigned to the indispensable tokens, whose removal leads to a dramatic performance decrease. The extensive experiments on the Transformer-based translation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model. We further find that the calibrated attention weights are more uniform at lower layers to collect multiple information while more concentrated on the specific inputs at higher layers.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Anchor-based Bilingual Word Embeddings for Low-Resource Languages,"Good quality monolingual word embeddings (MWEs) can be built for languages which have large amounts of unlabeled text. MWEs can be aligned to bilingual spaces using only a few thousand word translation pairs. For low resource languages training MWEs monolingually results in MWEs of poor quality, and thus poor bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) as well. This paper proposes a new approach for building BWEs in which the vector space of the high resource source language is used as a starting point for training an embedding space for the low resource target language. By using the source vectors as anchors the vector spaces are automatically aligned during training. We experiment on English-German, English-Hiligaynon and English-Macedonian.

Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English, and IWSLT and WMT English-German tasks support four general conclusions: that using pretrained context representations markedly improves sample efficiency, that adequate parallel data resources are crucial for learning to use document context, that jointly conditioning on multiple context representations outperforms any single representation, and that source context is more valuable for translation performance than target side context.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Exploiting Language Relatedness for Low Web-Resource Language Model Adaptation: An Indic Languages Study,"Recent research in multilingual language models (LM) has demonstrated their ability to effectively handle multiple languages in a single model. This holds promise for low web-resource languages (LRL) as multilingual models can enable transfer of supervision from high resource languages to LRLs. However, incorporating a new language in an LM still remains a challenge, particularly for languages with limited corpora and in unseen scripts. In this paper we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family may be exploited to overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs, and propose RelateLM. We focus on Indian languages, and exploit relatedness along two dimensions: (1) script (since many Indic scripts originated from the Brahmic script), and (2) sentence structure. RelateLM uses transliteration to convert the unseen script of limited LRL text into the script of a Related Prominent Language (RPL) (Hindi in our case). While exploiting similar sentence structures, RelateLM utilizes readily available bilingual dictionaries to pseudo translate RPL text into LRL corpora. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmark datasets provide validation to our hypothesis that using a related language as pivot, along with transliteration and pseudo translation based data augmentation, can be an effective way to adapt LMs for LRLs, rather than direct training or pivoting through English.","{'sequence': 'Recent research in multilingual language models (LM) has demonstrated their ability to effectively handle multiple languages in a single model.

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",On Finding the K-best Non-projective Dependency Trees,"The connection between the maximum spanning tree in a directed graph and the best dependency tree of a sentence has been exploited by the NLP community. However, for many dependency parsing schemes, an important detail of this approach is that the spanning tree must have exactly one edge emanating from the root. While work has been done to efficiently solve this problem for finding the one-best dependency tree, no research has attempted to extend this solution to finding the K-best dependency trees. This is arguably a more important extension as a larger proportion of decoded trees will not be subject to the root constraint of dependency trees. Indeed, we show that the rate of root constraint violations increases by an average of 13 times when decoding with K = 50 as opposed to K = 1. In this paper, we provide a simplification of the K-best spanning tree algorithm of Camerini  et al. (1980). Our simplification allows us to obtain a constant time speed-up over the original algorithm. Furthermore, we present a novel extension of the algorithm for decoding the K-best dependency trees of a graph which are subject to a root constraint. 1","{'sequence': 'The connection between the maximum spanning tree in a directed graph and the best dependency tree of a sentence has been exploited by the NLP community. However, for many dependency parsing schemes, an important detail of this approach is that the spanning tree must have exactly one edge emanating from the root. While work has been done to efficiently solve this problem for finding the one-best dependency tree, no research has attempted to extend this solution to finding the K-best dependency trees. This is arguably a more important extension as a larger proportion of decoded trees will not be subject to the root constraint of dependency trees. Indeed, we show that the rate of root constraint violations increases by an average of 13 times when decoding with K = 50 as opposed to K = 1. In this paper, we provide a simplification of the K-best spanning tree algorithm of Camerini  et al. (1980). Our simplification allows us to obtain a constant time speed-up over the original algorithm. Furthermore, we present a novel extension of the algorithm for decoding the K-best dependency trees of a graph which are subject to a root constraint. 1', 'labels': ['NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0824626237154007, 0.07735984027385712, 0.06240565702319145, 0.055425047874450684, 0.05369003862142563, 0.05013690143823624, 0.049683827906847, 0.04899345338344574, 0.04759522154927254, 0.04709151014685631, 0.04579624906182289, 0.041891008615493774, 0.040926963090896606, 0.03949294239282608, 0.037839632481336594, 0.03576766699552536, 0.03332940489053726, 0.03232452645897865, 0.030652450397610664, 0.02783012203872204, 0.026091666892170906, 0.021780360490083694, 0.011432874947786331]}",0.0824626237154007,NLP Applications,0.04899345338344574

NLP Applications,CLIP: A Dataset for Extracting Action Items for Physicians from Hospital Discharge Notes,"Continuity of care is crucial to ensuring positive health outcomes for patients discharged from an inpatient hospital setting, and improved information sharing can help. To share information, caregivers write discharge notes containing action items to share with patients and their future caregivers, but these action items are easily lost due to the lengthiness of the documents. In this work, we describe our creation of a dataset of clinical action items annotated over MIMIC-III, the largest publicly available dataset of real clinical notes. This dataset, which we call CLIP, is annotated by physicians and covers 718 documents representing 100K sentences. We describe the task of extracting the action items from these documents as multi-aspect extractive summarization, with each aspect representing a type of action to be taken. We evaluate several machine learning models on this task, and show that the best models exploit in-domain language model pre-training on 59K unannotated documents, and incorporate context from neighboring sentences. We also propose an approach to pre-training data selection that allows us to explore the trade-off between size and domainspecificity of pre-training datasets for this task.","{'sequence': 'Continuity of care is crucial to ensuring positive health outcomes for patients discharged from an inpatient hospital setting, and improved information sharing can help.

NLP Applications,"Select, Extract and Generate: Neural Keyphrase Generation with Layer-wise Coverage Attention","Natural language processing techniques have demonstrated promising results in keyphrase generation. However, one of the major challenges in neural keyphrase generation is processing long documents using deep neural networks. Generally, documents are truncated before given as inputs to neural networks. Consequently, the models may miss essential points conveyed in the target document. To overcome this limitation, we propose SEG-Net, a neural keyphrase generation model that is composed of two major components, (1) a selector that selects the salient sentences in a document and (2) an extractor-generator that jointly extracts and generates keyphrases from the selected sentences. SEG-Net uses Transformer, a selfattentive architecture, as the basic building block with a novel layer-wise coverage attention to summarize most of the points discussed in the document.

Our 2-step approach requires no supervision or even parallel corpora, only two off-the-shelf pretrained LMs in opposite directions: forward and backward. First, in the contextualization step, we use LMs to generate ensembles of past and future contexts which collectively capture the input (e.g. the source sentence for paraphrasing). Second, in the reflection step, we condition on these ""context ensembles"", generating outputs that are compatible with them.

Second, in the reflection step, we condition on these ""context ensembles"", generating outputs that are compatible with them. Comprehensive empirical results 1 demonstrate that REFLECTIVE DECODING outperforms strong unsupervised baselines on both paraphrasing and abductive text infilling, significantly narrowing the gap between unsupervised and supervised methods.

Generation,Towards Table-to-Text Generation with Numerical Reasoning,"Recent neural text generation models have shown significant improvement in generating descriptive text from structured data such as table formats. One of the remaining important challenges is generating more analytical descriptions that can be inferred from facts in a data source. The use of a template-based generator and a pointer-generator is among the potential alternatives for table-to-text generators. In this paper, we propose a framework consisting of a pre-trained model and a copy mechanism. The pre-trained models are fine-tuned to produce fluent text that is enriched with numerical reasoning. However, it still lacks fidelity to the table contents. The copy mechanism is incorporated in the fine-tuning step by using general placeholders to avoid producing hallucinated phrases that are not supported by a table while preserving high fluency. In summary, our contributions are (1) a new dataset for numerical table-to-text generation using pairs of a table and a paragraph of a table description with richer inference from scientific papers, and (2) a table-to-text generation framework enriched with numerical reasoning.","{'sequence': 'Recent neural text generation models have shown significant improvement in generating descriptive text from structured data such as table formats.

Summarization,Language Model as an Annotator: Exploring DialoGPT for Dialogue Summarization,"Current dialogue summarization systems usually encode the text with a number of general semantic features (e.g., keywords and topics) to gain more powerful dialogue modeling capabilities. However, these features are obtained via open-domain toolkits that are dialogagnostic or heavily relied on human annotations. In this paper, we show how DialoGPT  (Zhang et al., 2020b), a pre-trained model for conversational response generation, can be developed as an unsupervised dialogue annotator, which takes advantage of dialogue background knowledge encoded in DialoGPT. We apply DialoGPT to label three types of features on two dialogue summarization datasets, SAM-Sum and AMI, and employ pre-trained and non pre-trained models as our summarizers.

Summarization,Reinforcement Learning for Abstractive Question Summarization with Question-aware Semantic Rewards,"The growth of online consumer health questions has led to the necessity for reliable and accurate question answering systems. A recent study showed that manual summarization of consumer health questions brings significant improvement in retrieving relevant answers.

In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework for abstractive question summarization. We propose two novel rewards obtained from the downstream tasks of (i) question-type identification and (ii) question-focus recognition to regularize the question generation model. These rewards ensure the generation of semantically valid questions and encourage the inclusion of key medical entities/foci in the question summary.

Question Answering,A Gradually Soft Multi-Task and Data-Augmented Approach to Medical Question Understanding,"Users of medical question answering systems often submit long and detailed questions, making it hard to achieve high recall in answer retrieval. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) method with data augmentation for medical question understanding.

Based on this equivalence, we propose a data augmentation algorithm to use just one dataset to optimize for both tasks, with a weighted MTL loss. We introduce gradually soft parameter-sharing: a constraint for decoder parameters to be close, that is gradually loosened as we move to the highest layer. We show through ablation studies that our proposed novelties improve performance. Our method outperforms existing MTL methods across 4 datasets of medical question pairs, in ROUGE scores, RQE accuracy and human evaluation.

Information Extraction,MECT: Multi-Metadata Embedding based Cross-Transformer for Chinese Named Entity Recognition,"Recently, word enhancement has become very popular for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER), reducing segmentation errors and increasing the semantic and boundary information of Chinese words. However, these methods tend to ignore the information of the Chinese character structure after integrating the lexical information. Chinese characters have evolved from pictographs since ancient times, and their structure often reflects more information about the characters. This paper presents a novel Multi-metadata Embedding based Cross-Transformer (MECT) to improve the performance of Chinese NER by fusing the structural information of Chinese characters. Specifically, we use multi-metadata embedding in a two-stream Transformer to integrate Chinese character features with the radical-level embedding. With the structural characteristics of Chinese characters, MECT can better capture the semantic information of Chinese characters for NER. The experimental results obtained on several well-known benchmarking datasets demonstrate the merits and superiority of the proposed MECT method. 1","{'sequence': 'Recently, word enhancement has become very popular for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER), reducing segmentation errors and increasing the semantic and boundary information of Chinese words.

Our results show that solidarity became increasingly salient and contested during the crisis. While the number of solidarity tweets remained on a higher level and dominated the discourse in the scrutinized time frame, anti-solidarity tweets initially spiked, then decreased to (almost) pre-COVID-19 values before rising to a stable higher level until the end of 2020.","{'sequence': 'We introduce the well-established social scientific concept of social solidarity and its contestation, anti-solidarity, as a new problem setting to supervised machine learning in NLP to assess how European solidarity discourses changed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Measuring Conversational Uptake: A Case Study on Student-Teacher Interactions,"In conversation, uptake happens when a speaker builds on the contribution of their interlocutor by, for example, acknowledging, repeating or reformulating what they have said. In education, teachers' uptake of student contributions has been linked to higher student achievement. Yet measuring and improving teachers' uptake at scale is challenging, as existing methods require expensive annotation by experts. We propose a framework for computationally measuring uptake, by (1) releasing a dataset of student-teacher exchanges extracted from US math classroom transcripts annotated for uptake by experts; (2) formalizing uptake as pointwise Jensen-Shannon Divergence (PJSD), estimated via next utterance classification; (3) conducting a linguisticallymotivated comparison of different unsupervised measures and (4) correlating these measures with educational outcomes. We find that although repetition captures a significant part of uptake, PJSD outperforms repetitionbased baselines, as it is capable of identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and reformulation. We apply our uptake measure to three different educational datasets with outcome indicators. Unlike baseline measures, PJSD correlates significantly with instruction quality in all three, providing evidence for its generalizability and for its potential to serve as an automated professional development tool for teachers.","{'sequence': ""In conversation, uptake happens when a speaker builds on the contribution of their interlocutor by, for example, acknowledging, repeating or reformulating what they have said.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,A Survey of Code-switching: Linguistic and Social Perspectives for Language Technologies,"The analysis of data in which multiple languages are represented has gained popularity among computational linguists in recent years. So far, much of this research focuses mainly on the improvement of computational methods and largely ignores linguistic and social aspects of C-S discussed across a wide range of languages within the long-established literature in linguistics.

From the linguistic perspective, we provide an overview of structural and functional patterns of C-S focusing on the literature from European and Indian contexts as highly multilingual areas. From the language technologies perspective, we discuss how massive language models fail to represent diverse C-S types due to lack of appropriate training data, lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for C-S (across multilingual situations and types of C-S) and lack of end-toend systems that cover sociolinguistic aspects of C-S as well.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Sequence-to-Sequence Approach to Dialogue State Tracking,"This paper is concerned with dialogue state tracking (DST) in a task-oriented dialogue system. Building a DST module that is highly effective is still a challenging issue, although significant progresses have been made recently. This paper proposes a new approach to dialogue state tracking, referred to as Seq2Seq-DU, which formalizes DST as a sequence-tosequence problem. Seq2Seq-DU employs two BERT-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the dialogue and the descriptions of schemas, an attender to calculate attentions between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings, and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue. Seq2Seq-DU has the following advantages. It can jointly model intents, slots, and slot values; it can leverage the rich representations of utterances and schemas based on BERT; it can effectively deal with categorical and non-categorical slots, and unseen schemas. In addition, Seq2Seq-DU can also be used in the NLU (natural language understanding) module of a dialogue system. Experimental results on benchmark datasets in different settings (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1, WOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms the existing methods.","{'sequence': 'This paper is concerned with dialogue state tracking (DST) in a task-oriented dialogue system.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Discovering Dialog Structure Graph for Coherent Dialog Generation,"Learning discrete dialog structure graph from human-human dialogs yields basic insights into the structure of conversation, and also provides background knowledge to facilitate dialog generation. However, this problem is less studied in open-domain dialogue. In this paper, we conduct unsupervised discovery of discrete dialog structure from chitchat corpora, and then leverage it to facilitate coherent dialog generation in downstream systems. To this end, we present an unsupervised model, Discrete Variational Auto-Encoder with Graph Neural Network (DVAE-GNN), to discover discrete hierarchical latent dialog states (at the level of both session and utterance) and their transitions from corpus as a dialog structure graph. Then we leverage it as background knowledge to facilitate dialog management in a RL based dialog system. Experimental results on two benchmark corpora confirm that DVAE-GNN can discover meaningful dialog structure graph, and the use of dialog structure as background knowledge can significantly improve multi-turn coherence.","{'sequence': 'Learning discrete dialog structure graph from human-human dialogs yields basic insights into the structure of conversation, and also provides background knowledge to facilitate dialog generation.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dialogue Response Selection with Hierarchical Curriculum Learning,"We study the learning of a matching model for dialogue response selection. Motivated by the recent finding that models trained with random negative samples are not ideal in real-world scenarios, we propose a hierarchical curriculum learning framework that trains the matching model in an ""easy-to-difficult"" scheme.

In CC, the model gradually increases its ability in finding the matching clues between the dialogue context and a response candidate.

Information Extraction,Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly Labeled Data,"Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language processing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly focuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without any human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one can achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER with manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model performance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep NER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage computational framework -NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak label completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final finetuning over the strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and Biomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEE-DLE can effectively suppress the noise of the weak labels and outperforms existing methods.

Information Extraction,Ultra-Fine Entity Typing with Weak Supervision from a Masked Language Model,"Recently, there is an effort to extend finegrained entity typing by using a richer and ultra-fine set of types, and labeling noun phrases including pronouns and nominal nouns instead of just named entity mentions. A key challenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data are extremely scarce, and the annotation ability of existing distant or weak supervision approaches is very limited. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT Masked Language Model (MLM). Given a mention in a sentence, our approach constructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent hypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated labels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved substantially. We also show that our approach can be applied to improve traditional fine-grained entity typing after performing simple type mapping.","{'sequence': 'Recently, there is an effort to extend finegrained entity typing by using a richer and ultra-fine set of types, and labeling noun phrases including pronouns and nominal nouns instead of just named entity mentions.

To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT Masked Language Model (MLM). Given a mention in a sentence, our approach constructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent hypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated labels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved substantially.

Information Extraction,Improving Named Entity Recognition by External Context Retrieving and Cooperative Learning,"Recent advances in Named Entity Recognition (NER)  show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. In many application scenarios, however, such contexts are not available. In this paper, we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine, with the original sentence as the query. We find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view, constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts, can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence. Furthermore, we can improve the model performance of both input views by Cooperative Learning, a training method that encourages the two input views to produce similar contextual representations or output label distributions. Experiments show that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 8 NER data sets across 5 domains. 1","{'sequence': 'Recent advances in Named Entity Recognition (NER)  show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Using Adversarial Attacks to Reveal the Statistical Bias in Machine Reading Comprehension Models,"Pre-trained language models have achieved human-level performance on many Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks, but it remains unclear whether these models truly understand language or answer questions by exploiting statistical biases in datasets. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet effective method to attack MRC models and reveal the statistical biases in these models. We apply the method to the RACE dataset, for which the answer to each MRC question is selected from 4 options. It is found that several pre-trained language models, including BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, show consistent preference to some options, even when these options are irrelevant to the question. When interfered by these irrelevant options, the performance of MRC models can be reduced from human-level performance to the chance-level performance. Human readers, however, are not clearly affected by these irrelevant options. Finally, we propose an augmented training method that can greatly reduce models' statistical biases.","{'sequence': ""Pre-trained language models have achieved human-level performance on many Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks, but it remains unclear whether these models truly understand language or answer questions by exploiting statistical biases in datasets.

Ethics and NLP,"A Survey of Race, Racism, and Anti-Racism in NLP","Despite inextricable ties between race and language, little work has considered race in NLP research and development. In this work, we survey 79 papers from the ACL anthology that mention race. These papers reveal various types of race-related bias in all stages of NLP model development, highlighting the need for proactive consideration of how NLP systems can uphold racial hierarchies. However, persistent gaps in research on race and NLP remain: race has been siloed as a niche topic and remains ignored in many NLP tasks; most work operationalizes race as a fixed singledimensional variable with a ground-truth label, which risks reinforcing differences produced by historical racism; and the voices of historically marginalized people are nearly absent in NLP literature. By identifying where and how NLP literature has and has not considered race, especially in comparison to related fields, our work calls for inclusion and racial justice in NLP research practices. 5 We note that conceptualizations of AAE and the accompanying terminology for the variety have shifted considerably in the last half century; see King (2020) for an overview. 6 https://bit.ly/2Yv07IL 7 https://bit.ly/3j2weZA","{'sequence': 'Despite inextricable ties between race and language, little work has considered race in NLP research and development.

Ethics and NLP,RedditBias: A Real-World Resource for Bias Evaluation and Debiasing of Conversational Language Models,"Text representation models are prone to exhibit a range of societal biases, reflecting the noncontrolled and biased nature of the underlying pretraining data, which consequently leads to severe ethical issues and even bias amplification. Recent work has predominantly focused on measuring and mitigating bias in pretrained language models. Surprisingly, the landscape of bias measurements and mitigation resources and methods for conversational language models is still very scarce: it is limited to only a few types of bias, artificially constructed resources, and completely ignores the impact that debiasing methods may have on the final performance in dialog tasks, e.g., conversational response generation. In this work, we present REDDITBIAS, the first conversational data set grounded in the actual human conversations from Reddit, allowing for bias measurement and mitigation across four important bias dimensions: gender, race, religion, and queerness. Further, we develop an evaluation framework which simultaneously 1) measures bias on the developed REDDITBIAS resource, and 2) evaluates model capability in dialog tasks after model debiasing. We use the evaluation framework to benchmark the widely used conversational DialoGPT model along with the adaptations of four debiasing methods. Our results indicate that DialoGPT is biased with respect to religious groups and that some debiasing techniques can remove this bias while preserving downstream task performance.","{'sequence': 'Text representation models are prone to exhibit a range of societal biases, reflecting the noncontrolled and biased nature of the underlying pretraining data, which consequently leads to severe ethical issues and even bias amplification.

Ethics and NLP,"Men Are Elected, Women Are Married: Events Gender Bias on Wikipedia","Human activities can be seen as sequences of events, which are crucial to understanding societies.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Contributions of Transformer Attention Heads in Multi- and Cross-lingual Tasks,"This paper studies the relative importance of attention heads in Transformer-based models to aid their interpretability in cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. Prior research has found that only a few attention heads are important in each mono-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) task and pruning the remaining heads leads to comparable or improved performance of the model. However, the impact of pruning attention heads is not yet clear in cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) pruning a number of attention heads in a multilingual Transformer-based model has, in general, positive effects on its performance in cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks and (2) the attention heads to be pruned can be ranked using gradients and identified with a few trial experiments. Our experiments focus on sequence labeling tasks, with potential applicability on other cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. For comprehensiveness, we examine two pre-trained multi-lingual models, namely multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) and XLM-R, on three tasks across 9 languages each. We also discuss the validity of our findings and their extensibility to truly resource-scarce languages and other task settings.","{'sequence': 'This paper studies the relative importance of attention heads in Transformer-based models to aid their interpretability in cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Crafting Adversarial Examples for Neural Machine Translation,"Effective adversary generation for neural machine translation (NMT) is a crucial prerequisite for building robust machine translation systems. In this work, we investigate veritable evaluations of NMT adversarial attacks, and propose a novel method to craft NMT adversarial examples. We first show the current NMT adversarial attacks may be improperly estimated by the commonly used monodirectional translation, and we propose to leverage the round-trip translation technique to build valid metrics for evaluating NMT adversarial attacks. Our intuition is that an effective NMT adversarial example, which imposes minor shifting on the source and degrades the translation dramatically, would naturally lead to a semantic-destroyed round-trip translation result. We then propose a promising black-box attack method called Word Saliency speedup Local Search (WSLS) that could effectively attack the mainstream NMT architectures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed metrics could accurately evaluate the attack effectiveness, and the proposed WSLS could significantly break the state-of-art NMT models with small perturbation. Besides, WSLS exhibits strong transferability on attacking Baidu and Bing online translators.","{'sequence': 'Effective adversary generation for neural machine translation (NMT) is a crucial prerequisite for building robust machine translation systems.

At its core, UXLA performs simultaneous selftraining with data augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on three diverse zero-resource cross-lingual transfer tasks.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Glancing Transformer for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"Recent work on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) aims at improving the efficiency by parallel decoding without sacrificing the quality. However, existing NAT methods are either inferior to Transformer or require multiple decoding passes, leading to reduced speedup. We propose the Glancing Language Model (GLM) for single-pass parallel generation models. With GLM, we develop Glancing Transformer (GLAT) for machine translation. With only single-pass parallel decoding, GLAT is able to generate high-quality translation with 8×-15× speedup. Note that GLAT does not modify the network architecture, which is a training method to learn word interdependency. Experiments on multiple WMT language directions show that GLAT outperforms all previous single pass non-autoregressive methods, and is nearly comparable to Transformer, reducing the gap to 0.25-0.9 BLEU points.","{'sequence': 'Recent work on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) aims at improving the efficiency by parallel decoding without sacrificing the quality.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Modeling Task-Aware MIMO Cardinality for Efficient Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Neural machine translation has achieved great success in bilingual settings, as well as in multilingual settings. With the increase of the number of languages, multilingual systems tend to underperform their bilingual counterparts. Model capacity has been found crucial for massively multilingual NMT to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics. Previous work increases the modeling capacity by deepening or widening the Transformer. However, modeling cardinality based on aggregating a set of transformations with the same topology has been proven more effective than going deeper or wider when increasing capacity. In this paper, we propose to efficiently increase the capacity for multilingual NMT by increasing the cardinality. Unlike previous work which feeds the same input to several transformations and merges their outputs into one, we present a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) architecture that allows each transformation of the block to have its own input. We also present a task-aware attention mechanism to learn to selectively utilize individual transformations from a set of transformations for different translation directions.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Hierarchical Context-aware Network for Dense Video Event Captioning,"Dense video event captioning aims to generate a sequence of descriptive captions for each event in a long untrimmed video.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Context-aware Network for dense video event captioning (HCN) to capture context from various aspects. In detail, the model leverages local and global context with different mechanisms to jointly learn to generate coherent captions. The local context module performs full interaction between neighbor frames and the global context module selectively attends to previous or future events. According to our extensive experiment on both Youcook2 and Activitynet Captioning datasets, the videolevel HCN model outperforms the event-level context-agnostic model by a large margin.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Control Image Captioning Spatially and Temporally,"Generating image captions with user intention is an emerging need. The recently published Localized Narratives dataset takes mouse traces as another input to the image captioning task, which is an intuitive and efficient way for a user to control what to describe in the image. However, how to effectively employ traces to improve generation quality and controllability is still under exploration. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a novel model called LoopCAG, which connects Contrastive constraints and Attention Guidance in a Loop manner, engaged explicit spatial and temporal constraints to the generating process. Precisely, each generated sentence is temporally aligned to the corresponding trace sequence through a contrastive learning strategy. Besides, each generated text token is supervised to attend to the correct visual objects under heuristic spatial attention guidance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our LoopCAG model learns better correspondence among the three modalities(vision, language, and traces) and achieves SOTA performance on trace controlled image captioning task. Moreover, the controllability and explainability of LoopCAG are validated by analyzing spatial and temporal sensitivity during the generation process.","{'sequence': 'Generating image captions with user intention is an emerging need.

Our dynamics model learns not just what objects are but also what they do: glass cups break when thrown, plastic ones don't. We then use it as the interface to our language model, giving us a unified model of linguistic form and grounded meaning. PIGLeT can read a sentence, simulate neurally what might happen next, and then communicate that result through a literal symbolic representation, or natural language. Experimental results show that our model effectively learns world dynamics, along with how to communicate them. It is able to correctly forecast ""what happens next"" given an English sentence over 80% of the time, outperforming a 100x larger, text-to-text approach by over 10%.

Machine Learning for NLP,Modeling Fine-Grained Entity Types with Box Embeddings,"Neural entity typing models typically represent fine-grained entity types as vectors in a high-dimensional space, but such spaces are not well-suited to modeling these types' complex interdependencies. We study the ability of box embeddings, which embed concepts as d-dimensional hyperrectangles, to capture hierarchies of types even when these relationships are not defined explicitly in the ontology. Our model represents both types and entity mentions as boxes. Each mention and its context are fed into a BERT-based model to embed that mention in our box space; essentially, this model leverages typological clues present in the surface text to hypothesize a type representation for the mention. Box containment can then be used to derive both the posterior probability of a mention exhibiting a given type and the conditional probability relations between types themselves. We compare our approach with a vector-based typing model and observe state-of-the-art performance on several entity typing benchmarks. In addition to competitive typing performance, our box-based model shows better performance in prediction consistency (predicting a supertype and a subtype together) and confidence (i.e., calibration), demonstrating that the box-based model captures the latent type hierarchies better than the vector-based model does. 1","{'sequence': ""Neural entity typing models typically represent fine-grained entity types as vectors in a high-dimensional space, but such spaces are not well-suited to modeling these types' complex interdependencies.

When fixing the size of the small networks, weight distillation outperforms knowledge distillation by 0.51∼1.82 BLEU points.', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Generation', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'NLP Applications', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1542978286743164, 0.08686542510986328, 0.08339229971170425, 0.08286627382040024, 0.07821056246757507, 0.05803804472088814, 0.05022364482283592, 0.04127418249845505, 0.0356861874461174, 0.03489476814866066, 0.03408122435212135, 0.03117351047694683, 0.0306745246052742, 0.030504543334245682, 0.025363417342305183, 0.024963142350316048, 0.023076819255948067, 0.018160099163651466, 0.01676288992166519, 0.01585415005683899, 0.015304391272366047, 0.014845763333141804, 0.013486349023878574]}",0.1542978286743164,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.018160099163651466
Machine Learning for NLP,Optimizing Deeper Transformers on Small Datasets,"It is a common belief that training deep transformers from scratch requires large datasets. Consequently, for small datasets, people usually use shallow and simple additional layers on top of pre-trained models during finetuning. This work shows that this does not always need to be the case: with proper initialization and optimization, the benefits of very deep transformers can carry over to challenging tasks with small datasets, including Textto-SQL semantic parsing and logical reading comprehension. In particular, we successfully train 48 layers of transformers, comprising 24 fine-tuned layers from pre-trained RoBERTa and 24 relation-aware layers trained from scratch. With fewer training steps and no task-specific pre-training, we obtain the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging cross-domain Text-to-SQL parsing benchmark Spider 1 . We achieve this by deriving a novel Data-dependent Transformer Fixedupdate initialization scheme (DT-Fixup), inspired by the prior T-Fixup work (Huang et al., 2020) . Further error analysis shows that increasing depth can help improve generalization on small datasets for hard cases that require reasoning and structural understanding.","{'sequence': 'It is a common belief that training deep transformers from scratch requires large datasets.

Machine Learning for NLP,BERTAC: Enhancing Transformer-based Language Models with Adversarially Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks,"Transformer-based language models (TLMs), such as BERT, ALBERT and GPT-3, have shown strong performance in a wide range of NLP tasks and currently dominate the field of NLP. However, many researchers wonder whether these models can maintain their dominance forever. Of course, we do not have answers now, but, as an attempt to find better neural architectures and training schemes, we pretrain a simple CNN using a GAN-style learning scheme and Wikipedia data, and then integrate it with standard TLMs. We show that on the GLUE tasks, the combination of our pretrained CNN with ALBERT outperforms the original ALBERT and achieves a similar performance to that of SOTA. Furthermore, on open-domain QA (Quasar-T and SearchQA), the combination of the CNN with ALBERT or RoBERTa achieved stronger performance than SOTA and the original TLMs. We hope that this work provides a hint for developing a novel strong network architecture along with its training scheme.

NLP Applications,IrEne: Interpretable Energy Prediction for Transformers,"Existing software-based energy measurements of NLP models are not accurate because they do not consider the complex interactions between energy consumption and model execution. We present IrEne, an interpretable and extensible energy prediction system that accurately predicts the inference energy consumption of a wide range of Transformer-based NLP models. IrEne constructs a model tree graph that breaks down the NLP model into modules that are further broken down into low-level machine learning (ML) primitives. IrEne predicts the inference energy consumption of the ML primitives as a function of generalizable features and fine-grained runtime resource usage. IrEne then aggregates these low-level predictions recursively to predict the energy of each module and finally of the entire model. Experiments across multiple Transformer models show IrEne predicts inference energy consumption of transformer models with an error of under 7% compared to the ground truth. In contrast, existing energy models see an error of over 50%. We also show how IrEne can be used to conduct energy bottleneck analysis and to easily evaluate the energy impact of different architectural choices.

NLP Applications,Mitigating Bias in Session-based Cyberbullying Detection: A Non-Compromising Approach,"The element of repetition in cyberbullying behavior has directed recent computational studies toward detecting cyberbullying based on a social media session. In contrast to a single text, a session may consist of an initial post and an associated sequence of comments. Yet, emerging efforts to enhance the performance of session-based cyberbullying detection have largely overlooked unintended social biases in existing cyberbullying datasets. For example, a session containing certain demographicidentity terms (e.g., ""gay"" or ""black"") is more likely to be classified as an instance of cyberbullying. In this paper, we first show evidence of such bias in models trained on sessions collected from different social media platforms (e.g., Instagram). We then propose a contextaware and model-agnostic debiasing strategy that leverages a reinforcement learning technique, without requiring any extra resources or annotations apart from a pre-defined set of sensitive triggers commonly used for identifying cyberbullying instances. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed strategy can simultaneously alleviate the impacts of the unintended biases and improve the detection performance.","{'sequence': 'The element of repetition in cyberbullying behavior has directed recent computational studies toward detecting cyberbullying based on a social media session.

NLP Applications,PlotCoder: Hierarchical Decoding for Synthesizing Visualization Code in Programmatic Context,"Creating effective visualization is an important part of data analytics. While there are many libraries for creating visualizations, writing such code remains difficult given the myriad of parameters that users need to provide. In this paper, we propose the new task of synthesizing visualization programs from a combination of natural language utterances and code context. To tackle the learning problem, we introduce PLOTCODER, a new hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture that models both the code context and the input utterance. We use PLOTCODER to first determine the template of the visualization code, followed by predicting the data to be plotted. We use Jupyter notebooks containing visualization programs crawled from GitHub to train PLOTCODER. On a comprehensive set of test samples from those notebooks, we show that PLOTCODER correctly predicts the plot type of about 70% samples, and synthesizes the correct programs for 35% samples, performing 3-4.5% better than the baselines. 1","{'sequence': 'Creating effective visualization is an important part of data analytics.

Machine Learning for NLP,EarlyBERT: Efficient BERT Training via Early-bird Lottery Tickets,"Heavily overparameterized language models such as BERT, XLNet and T5 have achieved impressive success in many NLP tasks. However, their high model complexity requires enormous computation resources and extremely long training time for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Many works have studied model compression on large NLP models, but only focusing on reducing inference time while still requiring an expensive training process. Other works use extremely large batch sizes to shorten the pre-training time, at the expense of higher computational resource demands. In this paper, inspired by the Early-Bird Lottery Tickets recently studied for computer vision tasks, we propose EarlyBERT, a general computationally-efficient training algorithm applicable to both pre-training and fine-tuning of large-scale language models. By slimming the self-attention and fullyconnected sub-layers inside a transformer, we are the first to identify structured winning tickets in the early stage of BERT training. We apply those tickets towards efficient BERT training, and conduct comprehensive pre-training and fine-tuning experiments on GLUE and SQuAD downstream tasks. Our results show that EarlyBERT achieves comparable performance to standard BERT, with 35∼45% less training time.

Machine Learning for NLP,On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation,"Adapter-based tuning has recently arisen as an alternative to fine-tuning. It works by adding light-weight adapter modules to a pretrained language model (PrLM) and only updating the parameters of adapter modules when learning on a downstream task. As such, it adds only a few trainable parameters per new task, allowing a high degree of parameter sharing. Prior studies have shown that adapter-based tuning often achieves comparable results to finetuning. However, existing work only focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect of adapterbased tuning while lacking further investigation on its effectiveness. In this paper, we study the latter. We first show that adapterbased tuning better mitigates forgetting issues than fine-tuning since it yields representations with less deviation from those generated by the initial PrLM. We then empirically compare the two tuning methods on several downstream NLP tasks and settings. We demonstrate that 1) adapter-based tuning outperforms fine-tuning on low-resource and cross-lingual tasks; 2) it is more robust to overfitting and less sensitive to changes in learning rates. * * Equally Contributed † † Linlin, Qingyu, Bosheng, Liying, and Jia-wei are under the Joint PhD Program between Alibaba and their corresponding universities.

Machine Learning for NLP,Integrating Semantics and Neighborhood Information with Graph-Driven Generative Models for Document Retrieval,"With the need of fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint, document hashing has been playing a crucial role in large-scale information retrieval. To generate high-quality hashing code, both semantics and neighborhood information are crucial. However, most existing methods leverage only one of them or simply combine them via some intuitive criteria, lacking a theoretical principle to guide the integration process. In this paper, we encode the neighborhood information with a graph-induced Gaussian distribution, and propose to integrate the two types of information with a graph-driven generative model. To deal with the complicated correlations among documents, we further propose a tree-structured approximation method for learning. Under the approximation, we prove that the training objective can be decomposed into terms involving only singleton or pairwise documents, enabling the model to be trained as efficiently as uncorrelated ones. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model for simultaneously preserving semantic and neighborhood information. 1","{'sequence': 'With the need of fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint, document hashing has been playing a crucial role in large-scale information retrieval.

Resources and Evaluation,SMURF: SeMantic and linguistic UndeRstanding Fusion for Caption Evaluation via Typicality Analysis,"The open-ended nature of visual captioning makes it a challenging area for evaluation. The majority of proposed models rely on specialized training to improve human-correlation, resulting in limited adoption, generalizability, and explainabilty.

Typicality serves as our framework to develop a novel semantic comparison, SPARCS, as well as referenceless fluency evaluation metrics. Over the course of our analysis, two separate dimensions of fluency naturally emerge: style, captured by metric SPURTS, and grammar, captured in the form of grammatical outlier penalties.

Resources and Evaluation,Better than Average: Paired Evaluation of NLP systems,"Evaluation in NLP is usually done by comparing the scores of competing systems independently averaged over a common set of test instances. In this work, we question the use of averages for aggregating evaluation scores into a final number used to decide which system is best, since the average, as well as alternatives such as the median, ignores the pairing arising from the fact that systems are evaluated on the same test instances. We illustrate the importance of taking the instancelevel pairing of evaluation scores into account and demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, the advantages of aggregation methods based on pairwise comparisons, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, a mechanism based on the estimated probability that a given system scores better than another on the test set. By re-evaluating 296 real NLP evaluation setups across four tasks and 18 evaluation metrics, we show that the choice of aggregation mechanism matters and yields different conclusions as to which systems are state of the art in about 30% of the setups.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Chase: A Large-Scale and Pragmatic Chinese Dataset for Cross-Database Context-Dependent Text-to-SQL,"The cross-database context-dependent Text-to-SQL (XDTS) problem has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its wide range of potential applications.

These biases conceal the major challenges in XDTS to some extent. In this work, we present CHASE, a large-scale and pragmatic Chinese dataset for XDTS. It consists of 5,459 coherent question sequences (17,940 questions with their SQL queries annotated) over 280 databases, in which only 35% of questions are contextindependent, and 28% of SQL queries are easy. We experiment on CHASE with three state-ofthe-art XDTS approaches.

To study the impact of semantics caused by small perturbations, we conduct a series of pilot experiments and surprisingly find that adversarial training is useless or even harmful for the model to detect these semantic changes.

Experiments have validated that the proposed representations in emotion space can express emotion relations much better than word vectors in semantic space.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Generation', 'NLP Applications', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics'], 'scores': [0.1219860315322876, 0.08250504732131958, 0.06994185596704483, 0.06967177987098694, 0.0581238754093647, 0.05001655966043472, 0.04774460196495056, 0.04243053123354912, 0.0413571335375309, 0.041119471192359924, 0.040538378059864044, 0.03853520750999451, 0.0377972275018692, 0.03767629340291023, 0.03495870158076286, 0.03490559756755829, 0.03319935500621796, 0.0264491718262434, 0.026063838973641396, 0.0198370348662138, 0.016191935166716576, 0.01451319083571434, 0.014437086880207062]}",0.1219860315322876,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.016191935166716576
"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Style is NOT a single variable: Case Studies for Cross-Stylistic Language Understanding,"Every natural text is written in some style. Style is formed by a complex combination of different stylistic factors, including formality markers, emotions, metaphors, etc. One cannot form a complete understanding of a text without considering these factors. The factors combine and co-vary in complex ways to form styles. Studying the nature of the covarying combinations sheds light on stylistic language in general, sometimes called crossstyle language understanding. This paper provides the benchmark corpus (XSLUE) that combines existing datasets and collects a new one for sentence-level cross-style language understanding and evaluation. The benchmark contains text in 15 different styles under the proposed four theoretical groupings: figurative, personal, affective, and interpersonal groups. For valid evaluation, we collect an additional diagnostic set by annotating all 15 styles on the same text. Using XSLUE, we propose three interesting crossstyle applications in classification, correlation, and generation. First, our proposed crossstyle classifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall classification performance against individually-trained style classifiers. Second, our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in human-written text. Finally, we find that combinations of some contradictive styles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text. We believe our benchmark and case studies help explore interesting future directions for crossstyle research. The preprocessed datasets and code are publicly available. 1 * * This work was done while DK was at CMU. 1","{'sequence': 'Every natural text is written in some style.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Discovering Dialogue Slots with Weak Supervision,"Task-oriented dialogue systems typically require manual annotation of dialogue slots in training data, which is costly to obtain. We propose a method that eliminates this requirement: We use weak supervision from existing linguistic annotation models to identify potential slot candidates, then automatically identify domain-relevant slots by using clustering algorithms. Furthermore, we use the resulting slot annotation to train a neural-network-based tagger that is able to perform slot tagging with no human intervention. This tagger is trained solely on the outputs of our method and thus does not rely on any labeled data. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in slot tagging without labeled training data on four different dialogue domains.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Enhancing the generalization for Intent Classification and Out-of-Domain Detection in SLU,"Intent classification is a major task in spoken language understanding (SLU). Since most models are built with pre-collected in-domain (IND) training utterances, their ability to detect unsupported out-of-domain (OOD) utterances has a critical effect in practical use. Recent works have shown that using extra data and labels can improve the OOD detection performance, yet it could be costly to collect such data. This paper proposes to train a model with only IND data while supporting both IND intent classification and OOD detection. Our method designs a novel domain-regularized module (DRM) to reduce the overconfident phenomenon of a vanilla classifier, achieving a better generalization in both cases. Besides, DRM can be used as a drop-in replacement for the last layer in any neural network-based intent classifier, providing a low-cost strategy for a significant improvement.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Robustness Testing of Language Understanding in Task-Oriented Dialog,"Most language understanding models in taskoriented dialog systems are trained on a small amount of annotated training data, and evaluated in a small set from the same distribution. However, these models can lead to system failure or undesirable output when being exposed to natural language perturbation or variation in practice. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive evaluation and analysis with respect to the robustness of natural language understanding models, and introduce three important aspects related to language understanding in realworld dialog systems, namely, language variety, speech characteristics, and noise perturbation. We propose a model-agnostic toolkit LAUG to approximate natural language perturbations for testing the robustness issues in taskoriented dialog. Four data augmentation approaches covering the three aspects are assembled in LAUG, which reveals critical robustness issues in state-of-the-art models. The augmented dataset through LAUG can be used to facilitate future research on the robustness testing of language understanding in task-oriented dialog.","{'sequence': 'Most language understanding models in taskoriented dialog systems are trained on a small amount of annotated training data, and evaluated in a small set from the same distribution.

We propose a model-agnostic toolkit LAUG to approximate natural language perturbations for testing the robustness issues in taskoriented dialog. Four data augmentation approaches covering the three aspects are assembled in LAUG, which reveals critical robustness issues in state-of-the-art models. The augmented dataset through LAUG can be used to facilitate future research on the robustness testing of language understanding in task-oriented dialog.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09491422772407532, 0.0912749171257019, 0.0806535854935646, 0.05678056553006172, 0.05053073912858963, 0.048325516283512115, 0.04783125966787338, 0.047623392194509506, 0.046826060861349106, 0.04645364731550217, 0.043620508164167404, 0.043611399829387665, 0.03947685286402702, 0.03525711968541145, 0.03288879618048668, 0.031815070658922195, 0.030942561104893684, 0.030102014541625977, 0.026972128078341484, 0.023073023185133934, 0.021494895219802856, 0.01965351589024067, 0.009878232143819332]}",0.09491422772407532,Resources and Evaluation,0.0806535854935646
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Comprehensive Study: How the Context Information of Different Granularity Affects Dialogue State Tracking?,"Dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems to monitor the user's goal. In general, there are two strategies to track a dialogue state: predicting it from scratch and updating it from previous state. The scratch-based strategy obtains each slot value by inquiring all the dialogue history, and the previous-based strategy relies on the current turn dialogue to update the previous dialogue state. However, it is hard for the scratch-based strategy to correctly track shortdependency dialogue state because of noise; meanwhile, the previous-based strategy is not very useful for long-dependency dialogue state tracking. Obviously, it plays different roles for the context information of different granularity to track different kinds of dialogue states. Thus, in this paper, we will study and discuss how the context information of different granularity affects dialogue state tracking. First, we explore how greatly different granularities affect dialogue state tracking. Then, we further discuss how to combine multiple granularities for dialogue state tracking. Finally, we apply the findings about context granularity to fewshot learning scenario. Besides, we have publicly released all codes.","{'sequence': ""Dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems to monitor the user's goal.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,OTTers: One-turn Topic Transitions for Open-Domain Dialogue,"Mixed initiative in open-domain dialogue requires a system to pro-actively introduce new topics. The one-turn topic transition task explores how a system connects two topics in a cooperative and coherent manner. The goal of the task is to generate a ""bridging"" utterance connecting the new topic to the topic of the previous conversation turn. We are especially interested in commonsense explanations of how a new topic relates to what has been mentioned before. We first collect a new dataset of human one-turn topic transitions, which we call OTTers 1 . We then explore different strategies used by humans when asked to complete such a task, and notice that the use of a bridging utterance to connect the two topics is the approach used the most. We finally show how existing state-of-the-art text generation models can be adapted to this task and examine the performance of these baselines on different splits of the OTTers data.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Towards Robustness of Text-to-SQL Models against Synonym Substitution,"Recently, there has been significant progress in studying neural networks to translate text descriptions into SQL queries. Despite achieving good performance on some public benchmarks, existing text-to-SQL models typically rely on the lexical matching between words in natural language (NL) questions and tokens in table schemas, which may render the models vulnerable to attacks that break the schema linking mechanism. In this work, we investigate the robustness of text-to-SQL models to synonym substitution. In particular, we introduce Spider-Syn, a human-curated dataset based on the Spider benchmark for text-to-SQL translation. NL questions in Spider-Syn are modified from Spider, by replacing their schema-related words with manually selected synonyms that reflect real-world question paraphrases. We observe that the accuracy dramatically drops by eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL questions and table schemas, even if the synonyms are not adversarially selected to conduct worst-case adversarial attacks 1 . Finally, we present two categories of approaches to improve the model robustness. The first category of approaches utilizes additional synonym annotations for table schemas by modifying the model input, while the second category is based on adversarial training. We demonstrate that both categories of approaches significantly outperform their counterparts without the defense, and the first category of approaches are more effective. 2","{'sequence': 'Recently, there has been significant progress in studying neural networks to translate text descriptions into SQL queries.

However, existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP) mainly focus on ""WHY A"" rather than contrastive ""WHY A NOT B"", which is shown to be able to better distinguish confusing candidates and improve model performance in other research fields. In this paper, we focus on generating Contrastive Explanations with counterfactual examples in NLI and propose a novel Knowledge-Aware generation framework (KACE). Specifically, we first identify rationales (i.e., key phrases) from input sentences, and use them as key perturbations for generating counterfactual examples. After obtaining qualified counterfactual examples, we take them along with original examples and external knowledge as input, and employ a knowledge-aware generative pre-trained language model to generate contrastive explanations. Experimental results show that contrastive explanations are beneficial to clarify the difference between predicted answer and other answer options. Moreover, we train an BERT-large based NLI model enhanced with contrastive explanations and achieve an accuracy of 91.9% on SNLI, gaining an improvement of 5.7% against ETPA (""Explain-Then-Predict-Attention"") and 0.6% against NILE (""WHY A"").","{'sequence': 'In order to better understand the reason behind model behaviors (i.e., making predictions), most recent work has exploited generative models to provide complementary explanations.

Speech and Multimodality,Multi-stage Pre-training over Simplified Multimodal Pre-training Models,"Multimodal pre-training models, such as LXMERT, have achieved excellent results in downstream tasks. However, current pretrained models require large amounts of training data and have huge model sizes, which make them difficult to apply in low-resource situations.

Speech and Multimodality,Beyond Sentence-Level End-to-End Speech Translation: Context Helps,"Document-level contextual information has shown benefits to text-based machine translation, but whether and how context helps endto-end (E2E) speech translation (ST) is still under-studied. We fill this gap through extensive experiments using a simple concatenationbased context-aware ST model, paired with adaptive feature selection on speech encodings for computational efficiency. We investigate several decoding approaches, and introduce inmodel ensemble decoding which jointly performs document-and sentence-level translation using the same model. Our results on the MuST-C benchmark with Transformer demonstrate the effectiveness of context to E2E ST. Compared to sentence-level ST, context-aware ST obtains better translation quality (+0.18-2.61 BLEU), improves pronoun and homophone translation, shows better robustness to (artificial) audio segmentation errors, and reduces latency and flicker to deliver higher quality for simultaneous translation. 1","{'sequence': 'Document-level contextual information has shown benefits to text-based machine translation, but whether and how context helps endto-end (E2E) speech translation (ST) is still under-studied.

We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder, LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative positional relationship among different text blocks.

Speech and Multimodality,Missing Modality Imagination Network for Emotion Recognition with Uncertain Missing Modalities,"Multimodal fusion has been proved to improve emotion recognition performance in previous works. However, in real-world applications, we often encounter the problem of missing modality, and which modalities will be missing is uncertain. It makes the fixed multimodal fusion fail in such cases. In this work, we propose a unified model, Missing Modality Imagination Network (MMIN), to deal with the uncertain missing modality problem. MMIN learns robust joint multimodal representations, which can predict the representation of any missing modality given available modalities under different missing modality conditions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the unified MMIN model significantly improves emotion recognition performance under both uncertain missing-modality testing conditions and fullmodality ideal testing condition.

Speech and Multimodality,Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding: Integrating the Pre-trained Models into Speech Translation Encoders,"Encoder pre-training is promising in end-toend Speech Translation (ST), given the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce. But ST encoders are not simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine Translation (MT) encoders. For example, we find that ASR encoders lack the global context representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT encoders are not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic sequences. In this work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding (SATE) method for speech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the acoustic sequence as usual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a global representation of the input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward to incorporate the pre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an adaptor module to alleviate the representation inconsistency between the pre-trained ASR encoder and MT encoder, and develop a multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to preserve the pre-training knowledge. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and MuST-C En-De ST tasks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 18.3 and 25.2. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop an end-to-end ST system that achieves comparable or even better BLEU performance than the cascaded ST counterpart when large-scale ASR and MT data is available 1 .","{'sequence': 'Encoder pre-training is promising in end-toend Speech Translation (ST), given the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce.

Previous graphbased methods on this setting typically generate hidden nodes with the dummy label inside the n-ary nodes, in order to transform the tree into a binary tree for prediction. The limitation is that the hidden nodes break the sibling relations of the n-ary node's children. Consequently, the dependencies of such sibling constituents might not be accurately modeled and is being ignored. To solve this limitation, we propose a novel graph-based framework, which is called ""recursive semi-Markov model"". The main idea is to utilize 1-order semi-Markov model to predict the immediate children sequence of a constituent candidate, which then recursively serves as a child candidate of its parent. In this manner, the dependencies of sibling constituents can be described by 1-order transition features, which solves the above limitation. Through experiments, the proposed framework obtains the F1 of 95.92% and 92.50% on the datasets of PTB and CTB 5.1 respectively.

We show that with limited context (either bounded, or unidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent the max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can represent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Generation', 'Summarization', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond'], 'scores': [0.21355481445789337, 0.18944428861141205, 0.10312746465206146, 0.060241442173719406, 0.036739181727170944, 0.03642583265900612, 0.03003721497952938, 0.029563212767243385, 0.02903042733669281, 0.026033420115709305, 0.025802554562687874, 0.024797270074486732, 0.024347446858882904, 0.02312760055065155, 0.02176017500460148, 0.02163921296596527, 0.02010723389685154, 0.02002156898379326, 0.01641307771205902, 0.016192220151424408, 0.0139834675937891, 0.009086303412914276, 0.00852455198764801]}",0.21355481445789337,Machine Learning for NLP,0.03003721497952938

On social media platforms, hateful and offensive language negatively impact the mental well-being of users and the participation of people from diverse backgrounds. Automatic methods to detect offensive language have largely relied on datasets with categorical labels. However, comments can vary in their degree of offensiveness. We create the first dataset of English language Reddit comments that has finegrained, real-valued scores between -1 (maximally supportive) and 1 (maximally offensive). The dataset was annotated using Best-Worst Scaling, a form of comparative annotation that has been shown to alleviate known biases of using rating scales.

Resources and Evaluation,Towards Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation,"Automatic dialogue coherence evaluation has attracted increasing attention and is crucial for developing promising dialogue systems. However, existing metrics have two major limitations: (a) they are mostly trained in a simplified two-level setting (coherent vs. incoherent), while humans give Likert-type multi-level coherence scores, dubbed as ""quantifiable""; (b) their predicted coherence scores cannot align with the actual human rating standards due to the absence of human guidance during training. To address these limitations, we propose Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation (QuantiDCE), a novel framework aiming to train a quantifiable dialogue coherence metric that can reflect the actual human rating standards. Specifically, QuantiDCE includes two training stages, Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) pre-training and Knowledge Distillation (KD) fine-tuning. During MLR pre-training, a new MLR loss is proposed for enabling the model to learn the coarse judgement of coherence degrees. Then, during KD fine-tuning, the pretrained model is further finetuned to learn the actual human rating standards with only very few human-annotated data. To advocate the generalizability even with limited finetuning data, a novel KD regularization is introduced to retain the knowledge learned at the pre-training stage. Experimental results show that the model trained by QuantiDCE presents stronger correlations with human judgements than the other state-of-the-art metrics. 1","{'sequence': 'Automatic dialogue coherence evaluation has attracted increasing attention and is crucial for developing promising dialogue systems.

Resources and Evaluation,Assessing the Representations of Idiomaticity in Vector Models with a Noun Compound Dataset Labeled at Type and Token Levels,"Accurate assessment of the ability of embedding models to capture idiomaticity may require evaluation at token rather than type level, to account for degrees of idiomaticity and possible ambiguity between literal and idiomatic usages.

Information Extraction,Interpretable and Low-Resource Entity Matching via Decoupling Feature Learning from Decision Making,"Entity Matching (EM) aims at recognizing entity records that denote the same real-world object. Neural EM models learn vector representation of entity descriptions and match entities end-to-end. Though robust, these methods require many annotated resources for training, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel EM framework that consists of Heterogeneous Information Fusion (HIF) and Key Attribute Tree (KAT) Induction to decouple feature representation from matching decision. Using self-supervised learning and mask mechanism in pre-trained language modeling, HIF learns the embeddings of noisy attribute values by inter-attribute attention with unlabeled data. Using a set of comparison features and a limited amount of annotated data, KAT Induction learns an efficient decision tree that can be interpreted by generating entity matching rules whose structure is advocated by domain experts. Experiments on 6 public datasets and 3 industrial datasets show that our method is highly efficient and outperforms SOTA EM models in most cases.

Information Extraction,Locate and Label: A Two-stage Identifier for Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a wellstudied task in natural language processing. Traditional NER research only deals with flat entities and ignores nested entities. The span-based methods treat entity recognition as a span classification task. Although these methods have the innate ability to handle nested NER, they suffer from high computational cost, ignorance of boundary information, under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities, and difficulties in long entity recognition. To tackle these issues, we propose a two-stage entity identifier. First we generate span proposals by filtering and boundary regression on the seed spans to locate the entities, and then label the boundaryadjusted span proposals with the corresponding categories. Our method effectively utilizes the boundary information of entities and partially matched spans during training. Through boundary regression, entities of any length can be covered theoretically, which improves the ability to recognize long entities. In addition, many low-quality seed spans are filtered out in the first stage, which reduces the time complexity of inference. Experiments on nested NER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.","{'sequence': 'Named entity recognition (NER) is a wellstudied task in natural language processing.

Information Extraction,Text2Event: Controllable Sequence-to-Structure Generation for End-to-end Event Extraction,"Event extraction is challenging due to the complex structure of event records and the semantic gap between text and event. Traditional methods usually extract event records by decomposing the complex structure prediction task into multiple subtasks. In this paper, we propose TEXT2EVENT, a sequence-to-structure generation paradigm that can directly extract events from the text in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we design a sequence-to-structure network for unified event extraction, a constrained decoding algorithm for event knowledge injection during inference, and a curriculum learning algorithm for efficient model learning. Experimental results show that, by uniformly modeling all tasks in a single model and universally predicting different labels, our method can achieve competitive performance using only record-level annotations in both supervised learning and transfer learning settings.","{'sequence': 'Event extraction is challenging due to the complex structure of event records and the semantic gap between text and event.

Information Extraction,A Large-Scale Chinese Multimodal NER Dataset with Speech Clues,"In this paper, we aim to explore an uncharted territory, which is Chinese multimodal named entity recognition (NER) with both textual and acoustic contents. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale human-annotated Chinese multimodal NER dataset, named CNERTA. Our corpus totally contains 42,987 annotated sentences accompanying by 71 hours of speech data. Based on this dataset, we propose a family of strong and representative baseline models, which can leverage textual features or multimodal features. Upon these baselines, to capture the natural monotonic alignment between the textual modality and the acoustic modality, we further propose a simple multimodal multitask model by introducing a speech-to-text alignment auxiliary task. Through extensive experiments, we observe that: (1) Progressive performance boosts as we move from unimodal to multimodal, verifying the necessity of integrating speech clues into Chinese NER.

Information Extraction,A Neural Transition-based Joint Model for Disease Named Entity Recognition and Normalization,"Disease is one of the fundamental entities in biomedical research. Recognizing such entities from biomedical text and then normalizing them to a standardized disease vocabulary offer a tremendous opportunity for many downstream applications. Previous studies have demonstrated that joint modeling of the two sub-tasks has superior performance than the pipelined counterpart. Although the neural joint model based on multi-task learning framework has achieved state-of-the-art performance, it suffers from the boundary inconsistency problem due to the separate decoding procedures. Moreover, it ignores the rich information (e.g., the text surface form) of each candidate concept in the vocabulary, which is quite essential for entity normalization. In this work, we propose a neural transition-based joint model to alleviate these two issues. We transform the end-to-end disease recognition and normalization task as an action sequence prediction task, which not only jointly learns the model with shared representations of the input, but also jointly searches the output by state transitions in one search space. Moreover, we introduce attention mechanisms to take advantage of the text surface form of each candidate concept for better normalization performance. Experimental results conducted on two publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","{'sequence': 'Disease is one of the fundamental entities in biomedical research.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Self-Training Sampling with Monolingual Data Uncertainty for Neural Machine Translation,"Self-training has proven effective for improving NMT performance by augmenting model training with synthetic parallel data. The common practice is to construct synthetic data based on a randomly sampled subset of large-scale monolingual data, which we empirically show is sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to improve the sampling procedure by selecting the most informative monolingual sentences to complement the parallel data. To this end, we compute the uncertainty of monolingual sentences using the bilingual dictionary extracted from the parallel data. Intuitively, monolingual sentences with lower uncertainty generally correspond to easy-to-translate patterns which may not provide additional gains.

The common practice is to construct synthetic data based on a randomly sampled subset of large-scale monolingual data, which we empirically show is sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to improve the sampling procedure by selecting the most informative monolingual sentences to complement the parallel data. To this end, we compute the uncertainty of monolingual sentences using the bilingual dictionary extracted from the parallel data.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Breaking the Corpus Bottleneck for Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation with Cross-Task Pre-training,"Context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale document-level parallel dataset. To break the corpus bottleneck, in this paper we aim to improve context-aware NMT by taking the advantage of the availability of both large-scale sentence-level parallel dataset and source-side monolingual documents. 1 To this end, we propose two pre-training tasks. One learns to translate a sentence from source language to target language on the sentencelevel parallel dataset while the other learns to translate a document from deliberately noised to original on the monolingual documents. Importantly, the two pre-training tasks are jointly and simultaneously learned via the same model, thereafter fine-tuned on scalelimited parallel documents from both sentencelevel and document-level perspectives. Experimental results on four translation tasks show that our approach significantly improves translation performance. One nice property of our approach is that the fine-tuned model can be used to translate both sentences and documents.","{'sequence': 'Context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale document-level parallel dataset.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Guiding Teacher Forcing with Seer Forcing for Neural Machine Translation,"Although teacher forcing has become the main training paradigm for neural machine translation, it usually makes predictions only conditioned on past information, and hence lacks global planning for the future.

Machine Learning for NLP,Lightweight Cross-Lingual Sentence Representation Learning,"Large-scale models for learning fixeddimensional cross-lingual sentence representations like LASER (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019b) lead to significant improvement in performance on downstream tasks. However, further increases and modifications based on such large-scale models are usually impractical due to memory limitations. In this work, we introduce a lightweight dual-transformer architecture with just 2 layers for generating memory-efficient cross-lingual sentence representations. We explore different training tasks and observe that current cross-lingual training tasks leave a lot to be desired for this shallow architecture. To ameliorate this, we propose a novel cross-lingual language model, which combines the existing single-word masked language model with the newly proposed cross-lingual token-level reconstruction task. We further augment the training task by the introduction of two computationally-lite sentence-level contrastive learning tasks to enhance the alignment of cross-lingual sentence representation space, which compensates for the learning bottleneck of the lightweight transformer for generative tasks. Our comparisons with competing models on cross-lingual sentence retrieval and multilingual document classification confirm the effectiveness of the newly proposed training tasks for a shallow model. 1","{'sequence': 'Large-scale models for learning fixeddimensional cross-lingual sentence representations like LASER (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019b) lead to significant improvement in performance on downstream tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,ERNIE-Doc: A Retrospective Long-Document Modeling Transformer,"Transformers are not suited for processing long documents, due to their quadratically increasing memory and time consumption. Simply truncating a long document or applying the sparse attention mechanism will incur the context fragmentation problem or lead to an inferior modeling capability against comparable model sizes. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-DOC, a document-level language pretraining model based on Recurrence Transformers (Dai et al., 2019).

Machine Learning for NLP,Marginal Utility Diminishes: Exploring the Minimum Knowledge for BERT Knowledge Distillation,"Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great success in BERT compression. Instead of only learning from the teacher's soft label as in conventional KD, researchers find that the rich information contained in the hidden layers of BERT is conducive to the student's performance. To better exploit the hidden knowledge, a common practice is to force the student to deeply mimic the teacher's hidden states of all the tokens in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, however, we observe that although distilling the teacher's hidden state knowledge (HSK) is helpful, the performance gain (marginal utility) diminishes quickly as more HSK is distilled. To understand this effect, we conduct a series of analysis. Specifically, we divide the HSK of BERT into three dimensions, namely depth, length and width. We first investigate a variety of strategies to extract crucial knowledge for each single dimension and then jointly compress the three dimensions. In this way, we show that 1) the student's performance can be improved by extracting and distilling the crucial HSK, and 2) using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the same performance as extensive HSK distillation. Based on the second finding, we further propose an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT, which does not require loading the teacher during the training of student. For two kinds of student models and computing devices, the proposed KD paradigm gives rise to training speedup of 2.7× ∼3.4×.","{'sequence': ""Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great success in BERT compression.

Machine Learning for NLP,Rational LAMOL: A Rationale-based Lifelong Learning Framework,"Lifelong learning (LL) aims to train a neural network on a stream of tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks.

When the human rationales are not available, we propose exploiting unsupervised generated rationales as substitutions. In the experiment, we tested Rational LAMOL on permutations of three datasets from the ERASER benchmark. The results show that our proposed framework outperformed vanilla LAMOL on most permutations.

Machine Learning for NLP,EnsLM: Ensemble Language Model for Data Diversity by Semantic Clustering,"Natural language processing often faces the problem of data diversity such as different domains, themes, styles and so on. Therefore, a single language model (LM) is insufficient to learn all knowledge from diverse samples. To solve this problem, we firstly propose an autoencoding topic model with mixture prior (mATM) to perform clustering for the data, where the clusters defined in semantic space describe the data diversity. Having obtained the clustering assignment for each sample, we develop the ensemble LM (En-sLM) with the technique of weight modulation. Specifically, EnsLM contains a backbone which is adjusted by a few modulated weights to fit for different sample clusters. As a result, the backbone learns the shared knowledge among all clusters while modulated weights extract the cluster-specific features.

Machine Learning for NLP,LeeBERT: Learned Early Exit for BERT with cross-level optimization,"Pre-trained language models like BERT are performant in a wide range of natural language tasks. However, they are resource exhaustive and computationally expensive for industrial scenarios. Thus, early exits are adopted at each layer of BERT to perform adaptive computation by predicting easier samples with the first few layers to speed up the inference. In this work, to improve efficiency without performance drop, we propose a novel training scheme called Learned Early Exiting for BERT (LeeBERT). First, we ask each exit to learn from each other, rather than learning only from the last layer. Second, the weights of different loss terms are learned, thus balancing off different objectives. We formulate the optimization of LeeBERT as a bi-level optimization problem, and we propose a novel cross-level optimization (CLO) algorithm to improve the optimization results.

NLP Applications,Competence-based Multimodal Curriculum Learning for Medical Report Generation,"Medical report generation task, which targets to produce long and coherent descriptions of medical images, has attracted growing research interests recently. Different from the general image captioning tasks, medical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models. This is mainly due to 1) the serious data bias and 2) the limited medical data. To alleviate the data bias and make best use of available data, we propose a Competencebased Multimodal Curriculum Learning framework (CMCL). Specifically, CMCL simulates the learning process of radiologists and optimizes the model in a step by step manner. Firstly, CMCL estimates the difficulty of each training instance and evaluates the competence of current model; Secondly, CMCL selects the most suitable batch of training instances considering current model competence. By iterating above two steps, CMCL can gradually improve the model's performance. The experiments on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets show that CMCL can be incorporated into existing models to improve their performance.","{'sequence': ""Medical report generation task, which targets to produce long and coherent descriptions of medical images, has attracted growing research interests recently.

NLP Applications,Meta-KD: A Meta Knowledge Distillation Framework for Language Model Compression across Domains,"Pre-trained language models have been applied to various NLP tasks with considerable performance gains. However, the large model sizes, together with the long inference time, limit the deployment of such models in realtime applications. One line of model compression approaches considers knowledge distillation to distill large teacher models into small student models. Most of these studies focus on single-domain only, which ignores the transferable knowledge from other domains. We notice that training a teacher with transferable knowledge digested across domains can achieve better generalization capability to help knowledge distillation. Hence we propose a Meta-Knowledge Distillation (Meta-KD) framework to build a meta-teacher model that captures transferable knowledge across domains and passes such knowledge to students. Specifically, we explicitly force the meta-teacher to capture transferable knowledge at both instance-level and feature-level from multiple domains, and then propose a meta-distillation algorithm to learn singledomain student models with guidance from the meta-teacher. Experiments on public multidomain NLP tasks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Meta-KD framework. Further, we also demonstrate the capability of Meta-KD in the settings where the training data is scarce.","{'sequence': 'Pre-trained language models have been applied to various NLP tasks with considerable performance gains.

Question Answering,A Semantic-based Method for Unsupervised Commonsense Question Answering,"Unsupervised commonsense question answering is appealing since it does not rely on any labeled task data. Among existing work, a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers. In this paper, we present a novel SEmanticbased Question Answering method (SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler (Jin et al., 2020) with synonym replacement, SEQA demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating stronger robustness.","{'sequence': 'Unsupervised commonsense question answering is appealing since it does not rely on any labeled task data.

Question Answering,Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection,"In several question answering benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning on an order of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question answering: recurring span selection.

In this paper, we study a hybrid approach for leveraging the strengths of both models. We apply novel techniques to enhance both extractive and generative readers built upon recent pretrained neural language models, and find that proper training methods can provide large improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. We demonstrate that an hybrid approach by combining answers from both readers can effectively take advantages of extractive and generative answer inference strategies and outperform single models as well as homogeneous ensembles.

We show that while state-of-the-art transformer models perform very well for small databases, they exhibit limitations in processing noisy data, numerical operations, and queries that aggregate facts. We propose a modular architecture to answer these database-style queries over multiple spans from text and aggregating these at scale. We evaluate the architecture using WIKINLDB, 1 a novel dataset for exploring such queries. Our architecture scales to databases containing thousands of facts whereas contemporary models are limited by how many facts can be encoded.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,How Good is Your Tokenizer? On the Monolingual Performance of Multilingual Language Models,"In this work, we provide a systematic and comprehensive empirical comparison of pretrained multilingual language models versus their monolingual counterparts with regard to their monolingual task performance. We study a set of nine typologically diverse languages with readily available pretrained monolingual models on a set of five diverse monolingual downstream tasks. We first aim to establish, via fair and controlled comparisons, if a gap between the multilingual and the corresponding monolingual representation model of that language exists, and subsequently investigate the reason for any performance difference. To disentangle conflating factors, we train new monolingual models on the same data, with monolingually and multilingually trained tokenizers. We find that while the pretraining data size is an important factor, a designated monolingual tokenizer plays an equally important role in the downstream performance. Our results show that languages that are adequately represented in the multilingual model's vocabulary exhibit negligible performance decreases over their monolingual counterparts. We further find that replacing the original multilingual tokenizer with the specialized monolingual tokenizer improves the downstream performance of the multilingual model for almost every task and language.","{'sequence': ""In this work, we provide a systematic and comprehensive empirical comparison of pretrained multilingual language models versus their monolingual counterparts with regard to their monolingual task performance.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Evaluating morphological typology in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer,"Cross-lingual transfer has improved greatly through multi-lingual language model pretraining, reducing the need for parallel data and increasing absolute performance.

In this paper, we address what effects morphological typology has on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer for two tasks: Part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis. We perform experiments on 19 languages from four language typologies (fusional, isolating, agglutinative, and introflexive) and find that transfer to another morphological type generally implies a higher loss than transfer to another language with the same morphological typology.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,From Machine Translation to Code-Switching: Generating High-Quality Code-Switched Text,"Generating code-switched text is a problem of growing interest, especially given the scarcity of corpora containing large volumes of real code-switched text. In this work, we adapt a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model to generate Hindi-English codeswitched sentences starting from monolingual Hindi sentences. We outline a carefully designed curriculum of pretraining steps, including the use of synthetic code-switched text, that enable the model to generate high-quality codeswitched text.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Fast and Accurate Neural Machine Translation with Translation Memory,"It is generally believed that a translation memory (TM) should be beneficial for machine translation tasks. Unfortunately, existing wisdom demonstrates the superiority of TMbased neural machine translation (NMT) only on the TM-specialized translation tasks rather than general tasks, with a non-negligible computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate approach to TM-based NMT within the Transformer framework: the model architecture is simple and employs a single bilingual sentence as its TM, leading to efficient training and inference; and its parameters are effectively optimized through a novel training criterion. Extensive experiments on six TM-specialized tasks show that the proposed approach substantially surpasses several strong baselines that use multiple TMs, in terms of BLEU and running time. In particular, the proposed approach also advances the strong baselines on two general tasks (WMT news Zh→En and En→De).","{'sequence': 'It is generally believed that a translation memory (TM) should be beneficial for machine translation tasks.

For autoregressive NMT models that generate target words from left to right, we observe that adversarial attack on the source language is more effective than on the target language, and that attacking front positions of target sentences or positions of source sentences aligned to the front positions of corresponding target sentences is more effective than attacking other positions. We further exploit the attention distribution of the victim model to attack source sentences at positions that have a strong association with front target words. Experiment results demonstrate that our attention-based adversarial attack is more effective than adversarial attacks by sampling positions randomly or according to gradients.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we empirically investigate adversarial attack on NMT from two aspects: languages (the source vs. the target language) and positions (front vs. back).

Thanks to the rich syntactic and discourse annotations in GUM, we are able to create the largest human-annotated coreference corpus following the OntoNotes guidelines, and the first to be evaluated for consistency with the OntoNotes scheme.

We make an OntoNotes-like coreference dataset called OntoGUM publicly available, converted from GUM, an English corpus covering 12 genres, using deterministic rules, which we evaluate. Thanks to the rich syntactic and discourse annotations in GUM, we are able to create the largest human-annotated coreference corpus following the OntoNotes guidelines, and the first to be evaluated for consistency with the OntoNotes scheme. Outof-domain evaluation across 12 genres shows nearly 15-20% degradation for both deterministic and deep learning systems, indicating a lack of generalizability or covert overfitting in existing coreference resolution models.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.2423304319381714, 0.05504433438181877, 0.0471852645277977, 0.046909719705581665, 0.046596866101026535, 0.04569857567548752, 0.044951181858778, 0.041490741074085236, 0.04141763597726822, 0.0380813330411911, 0.03798822686076164, 0.03601519763469696, 0.03433484211564064, 0.03295854479074478, 0.031308483332395554, 0.02801213413476944, 0.02761438861489296, 0.025006312876939774, 0.02110973559319973, 0.02068500593304634, 0.02021007426083088, 0.018000688403844833, 0.01705026626586914]}",0.2423304319381714,Resources and Evaluation,0.2423304319381714
Question Answering,Can Generative Pre-trained Language Models Serve As Knowledge Bases for Closed-book QA?,"Recent work has investigated the interesting question using pre-trained language models (PLMs) as knowledge bases for answering open questions. However, existing work is limited in using small benchmarks with high test-train overlaps. We construct a new dataset of closed-book QA using SQuAD, and investigate the performance of BART. Experiments show that it is challenging for BART to remember training facts in high precision, and also challenging to answer closed-book questions even if relevant knowledge is retained. Some promising directions are found, including decoupling the knowledge memorizing process and the QA finetune process, forcing the model to recall relevant knowledge when question answering.","{'sequence': 'Recent work has investigated the interesting question using pre-trained language models (PLMs) as knowledge bases for answering open questions.

Question Answering,Answering Ambiguous Questions through Generative Evidence Fusion and Round-Trip Prediction,"In open-domain question answering, questions are highly likely to be ambiguous because users may not know the scope of relevant topics when formulating them. Therefore, a system needs to find possible interpretations of the question, and predict one or multiple plausible answers. When multiple plausible answers are found, the system should rewrite the question for each answer to resolve the ambiguity. In this paper, we present a model that aggregates and combines evidence from multiple passages to adaptively predict a single answer or a set of question-answer pairs for ambiguous questions. In addition, we propose a novel round-trip prediction approach to iteratively generate additional interpretations that our model fails to find in the first pass, and then verify and filter out the incorrect questionanswer pairs to arrive at the final disambiguated output. Our model, named REFUEL, achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the AMBIGQA dataset, and shows competitive performance on NQ-OPEN and Trivi-aQA. The proposed round-trip prediction is a model-agnostic general approach for answering ambiguous open-domain questions, which improves our REFUEL as well as several baseline models.

Question Answering,TAT-QA: A Question Answering Benchmark on a Hybrid of Tabular and Textual Content in Finance,"Hybrid data combining both tabular and textual content (e.g., financial reports) are quite pervasive in the real world. However, Question Answering (QA) over such hybrid data is largely neglected in existing research. In this work, we extract samples from real financial reports to build a new large-scale QA dataset containing both Tabular And Textual data, named TAT-QA, where numerical reasoning is usually required to infer the answer, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, counting, comparison/sorting, and their compositions. We further propose a novel QA model termed TAGOP, which is capable of reasoning over both tables and text. It adopts sequence tagging to extract relevant cells from the table along with relevant spans from the text to infer their semantics, and then applies symbolic reasoning over them with a set of aggregation operators to arrive at the final answer. TAGOP achieves 58.0% in F 1 , which is an 11.1% absolute increase over the previous best baseline model, according to our experiments on TAT-QA. But this result still lags far behind the performance of human expert, i.e. 90.8% in F 1 . It demonstrates that our TAT-QA is very challenging and can serve as a benchmark for training and testing powerful QA models that address hybrid data.

We also perform an extensive analysis highlighting the limitations of our best performing model through an ablation study.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.5813438892364502, 0.07331155985593796, 0.03285109996795654, 0.028968622907996178, 0.027431940659880638, 0.0262677613645792, 0.02143925428390503, 0.01950600929558277, 0.0186820887029171, 0.018381252884864807, 0.01693570427596569, 0.016423970460891724, 0.015829263255000114, 0.014542235061526299, 0.014230095781385899, 0.013027552515268326, 0.010816781781613827, 0.010051148012280464, 0.010001160204410553, 0.009862244129180908, 0.008738762699067593, 0.006716717034578323, 0.004640964791178703]}",0.5813438892364502,Question Answering,0.5813438892364502
"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Evidence-based Factual Error Correction,"This paper introduces the task of factual error correction: performing edits to a claim so that the generated rewrite is better supported by evidence. This extends the well-studied task of fact verification by providing a mechanism to correct written texts that are refuted or only partially supported by evidence. We demonstrate that it is feasible to train factual error correction systems from existing fact checking datasets which only contain labeled claims accompanied by evidence, but not the correction. We achieve this by employing a two-stage distant supervision approach that incorporates evidence into masked claims when generating corrections. Our approach, based on the T5 transformer and using retrieved evidence, achieved better results than existing work which used a pointer copy network and gold evidence, producing accurate factual error corrections for 5x more instances in human evaluation and a .125 increase in SARI score.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Taming Pre-trained Language Models with N-gram Representations for Low-Resource Domain Adaptation,"Large pre-trained models such as BERT are known to improve different downstream NLP tasks, even when such a model is trained on a generic domain. Moreover, recent studies have shown that when large domain-specific corpora are available, continued pre-training on domain-specific data can further improve the performance of in-domain tasks. However, this practice requires significant domainspecific data and computational resources which may not always be available. In this paper, we aim to adapt a generic pretrained model with a relatively small amount of domain-specific data. We demonstrate that by explicitly incorporating the multi-granularity information of unseen and domain-specific words via the adaptation of (word based) ngrams, the performance of a generic pretrained model can be greatly improved. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based Domainaware N-gram Adaptor, T-DNA, to effectively learn and incorporate the semantic representation of different combinations of words in the new domain. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of T-DNA on eight lowresource downstream tasks from four domains. We show that T-DNA is able to achieve significant improvements compared to existing methods on most tasks using limited data with lower computational costs. Moreover, further analyses demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of both unseen words and the information of different granularities. 1","{'sequence': 'Large pre-trained models such as BERT are known to improve different downstream NLP tasks, even when such a model is trained on a generic domain.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Position Bias Mitigation: A Knowledge-Aware Graph Model for Emotion Cause Extraction,"The Emotion Cause Extraction (ECE) task aims to identify clauses which contain emotion-evoking information for a particular emotion expressed in text. We observe that a widely-used ECE dataset exhibits a bias that the majority of annotated cause clauses are either directly before their associated emotion clauses or are the emotion clauses themselves. Existing models for ECE tend to explore such relative position information and suffer from the dataset bias. To investigate the degree of reliance of existing ECE models on clause relative positions, we propose a novel strategy to generate adversarial examples in which the relative position information is no longer the indicative feature of cause clauses. We test the performance of existing models on such adversarial examples and observe a significant performance drop. To address the dataset bias, we propose a novel graph-based method to explicitly model the emotion triggering paths by leveraging the commonsense knowledge to enhance the semantic dependencies between a candidate clause and an emotion clause. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs on par with the existing stateof-the-art methods on the original ECE dataset, and is more robust against adversarial attacks compared to existing models. 1","{'sequence': 'The Emotion Cause Extraction (ECE) task aims to identify clauses which contain emotion-evoking information for a particular emotion expressed in text.

Recently, Key Point Analysis (KPA) has been proposed as a summarization framework that provides both textual and quantitative summary of the main points in the data. We adapt KPA to review data by introducing Collective Key Point Mining for better key point extraction; integrating sentiment analysis into KPA; identifying good key point candidates for review summaries; and leveraging the massive amount of available reviews and their metadata.

These results suggest that language models employ separate mechanisms to detect different types of linguistic anomalies.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08062434196472168, 0.07713764160871506, 0.07683826237916946, 0.07406505942344666, 0.06558474898338318, 0.05070864409208298, 0.04975168779492378, 0.04701324924826622, 0.045764241367578506, 0.04240872710943222, 0.042209427803754807, 0.04210994020104408, 0.04152190312743187, 0.03609449788928032, 0.03575883433222771, 0.034268274903297424, 0.03237707540392876, 0.02930009737610817, 0.024953290820121765, 0.020510204136371613, 0.01964874006807804, 0.018632911145687103, 0.01271816436201334]}",0.08062434196472168,Resources and Evaluation,0.03237707540392876
"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Psycholinguistic Tripartite Graph Network for Personality Detection,"Most of the recent work on personality detection from online posts adopts multifarious deep neural networks to represent the posts and builds predictive models in a data-driven manner, without the exploitation of psycholinguistic knowledge that may unveil the connections between one's language usage and his psychological traits. In this paper, we propose a psycholinguistic knowledge-based tripartite graph network, TrigNet, which consists of a tripartite graph network and a BERT-based graph initializer. The graph network injects structural psycholinguistic knowledge from LIWC, a computerized instrument for psycholinguistic analysis, by constructing a heterogeneous tripartite graph. The graph initializer is employed to provide initial embeddings for the graph nodes. To reduce the computational cost in graph learning, we further propose a novel flow graph attention network (GAT) that only transmits messages between neighboring parties in the tripartite graph. Benefiting from the tripartite graph, TrigNet can aggregate post information from a psychological perspective, which is a novel way of exploiting domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that TrigNet outperforms the existing state-of-art model by 3.47 and 2.10 points in average F1. Moreover, the flow GAT reduces the FLOPS and Memory measures by 38% and 32%, respectively, in comparison to the original GAT in our setting.","{'sequence': ""Most of the recent work on personality detection from online posts adopts multifarious deep neural networks to represent the posts and builds predictive models in a data-driven manner, without the exploitation of psycholinguistic knowledge that may unveil the connections between one's language usage and his psychological traits.

Speech and Multimodality,Improving Speech Translation by Understanding and Learning from the Auxiliary Text Translation Task,"Pretraining and multitask learning are widely used to improve the speech to text translation performance. In this study, we are interested in training a speech to text translation model along with an auxiliary text to text translation task. We conduct a detailed analysis to understand the impact of the auxiliary task on the primary task within the multitask learning framework. Our analysis confirms that multitask learning tends to generate similar decoder representations from different modalities and preserve more information from the pretrained text translation modules. We observe minimal negative transfer effect between the two tasks and sharing more parameters is helpful to transfer knowledge from the text task to the speech task. The analysis also reveals that the modality representation difference at the top decoder layers is still not negligible, and those layers are critical for the translation quality. Inspired by these findings, we propose three methods to improve translation quality. First, a parameter sharing and initialization strategy is proposed to enhance information sharing between the tasks. Second, a novel attention-based regularization is proposed for the encoders and pulls the representations from different modalities closer. Third, an online knowledge distillation is proposed to enhance the knowledge transfer from the text to the speech task. Our experiments show that the proposed approach improves translation performance by more than 2 BLEU over a strong baseline and achieves state-of-theart results on the MUST-C English-German, English-French and English-Spanish language pairs.","{'sequence': 'Pretraining and multitask learning are widely used to improve the speech to text translation performance.

Machine Learning for NLP,Convolutions and Self-Attention: Re-interpreting Relative Positions in Pre-trained Language Models,"In this paper, we detail the relationship between convolutions and self-attention in natural language tasks. We show that relative position embeddings in self-attention layers are equivalent to recently-proposed dynamic lightweight convolutions, and we consider multiple new ways of integrating convolutions into Transformer self-attention.

Machine Learning for NLP,BinaryBERT: Pushing the Limit of BERT Quantization,"The rapid development of large pre-trained language models has greatly increased the demand for model compression techniques, among which quantization is a popular solution. In this paper, we propose Binary-BERT, which pushes BERT quantization to the limit by weight binarization. We find that a binary BERT is hard to be trained directly than a ternary counterpart due to its complex and irregular loss landscape. Therefore, we propose ternary weight splitting, which initializes BinaryBERT by equivalently splitting from a half-sized ternary network. The binary model thus inherits the good performance of the ternary one, and can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the new architecture after splitting.

Across an extensive set of experiments on 8 datasets/tasks, we find that CNN-based pre-trained models are competitive and outperform their Transformer counterpart in certain scenarios, albeit with caveats. Overall, the findings outlined in this paper suggest that conflating pre-training and architectural advances is misguided and that both advances should be considered independently.

Machine Learning for NLP,Hierarchy-aware Label Semantics Matching Network for Hierarchical Text Classification,"Hierarchical text classification is an important yet challenging task due to the complex structure of the label hierarchy. Existing methods ignore the semantic relationship between text and labels, so they cannot make full use of the hierarchical information. To this end, we formulate the text-label semantics relationship as a semantic matching problem and thus propose a hierarchy-aware label semantics matching network (HiMatch). First, we project text semantics and label semantics into a joint embedding space. We then introduce a joint embedding loss and a matching learning loss to model the matching relationship between the text semantics and the label semantics. Our model captures the text-label semantics matching relationship among coarse-grained labels and fine-grained labels in a hierarchy-aware manner. The experimental results on various benchmark datasets verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.","{'sequence': 'Hierarchical text classification is an important yet challenging task due to the complex structure of the label hierarchy.

Machine Learning for NLP,HiddenCut: Simple Data Augmentation for Natural Language Understanding with Better Generalizability,"Fine-tuning large pre-trained models with taskspecific data has achieved great success in NLP. However, it has been demonstrated that the majority of information within the selfattention networks is redundant and not utilized effectively during the fine-tuning stage. This leads to inferior results when generalizing the obtained models to out-of-domain distributions. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation technique, HiddenCut, to better regularize the model and encourage it to learn more generalizable features. Specifically, contiguous spans within the hidden space are dynamically and strategically dropped during training. Experiments show that our HiddenCut method outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation methods on the GLUE benchmark, and consistently exhibits superior generalization performances on out-of-distribution and challenging counterexamples.

Machine Learning for NLP,Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers,"Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n 1.5 d) from O(n 2 d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,QA-Driven Zero-shot Slot Filling with Weak Supervision Pretraining,"Slot-filling is an essential component for building task-oriented dialog systems. In this work, we focus on the zero-shot slot-filling problem, where the model needs to predict slots and their values, given utterances from new domains without training on the target domain. Prior methods directly encode slot descriptions to generalize to unseen slot types. However, raw slot descriptions are often ambiguous and do not encode enough semantic information, limiting the models' zero-shot capability. To address this problem, we introduce QA-driven slot filling (QASF), which extracts slot-filler spans from utterances with a span-based QA model.

In this work, we focus on the zero-shot slot-filling problem, where the model needs to predict slots and their values, given utterances from new domains without training on the target domain. Prior methods directly encode slot descriptions to generalize to unseen slot types. However, raw slot descriptions are often ambiguous and do not encode enough semantic information, limiting the models' zero-shot capability. To address this problem, we introduce QA-driven slot filling (QASF), which extracts slot-filler spans from utterances with a span-based QA model.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Pre-training Strategy for Zero-Resource Response Selection in Knowledge-Grounded Conversations,"Recently, many studies are emerging towards building a retrieval-based dialogue system that is able to effectively leverage background knowledge (e.g., documents) when conversing with humans. However, it is non-trivial to collect large-scale dialogues that are naturally grounded on the background documents, which hinders the effective and adequate training of knowledge selection and response matching. To overcome the challenge, we consider decomposing the training of the knowledge-grounded response selection into three tasks including: 1) query-passage matching task; 2) query-dialogue history matching task; 3) multi-turn response matching task, and joint learning all these tasks in a unified pre-trained language model. The former two tasks could help the model in knowledge selection and comprehension, while the last task is designed for matching the proper response with the given query and background knowledge (dialogue history). By this means, the model can be learned to select relevant knowledge and distinguish proper response, with the help of ad-hoc retrieval corpora and a large number of ungrounded multi-turn dialogues. Experimental results on two benchmarks of knowledge-grounded response selection indicate that our model can achieve comparable performance with several existing methods that rely on crowd-sourced data for training.","{'sequence': 'Recently, many studies are emerging towards building a retrieval-based dialogue system that is able to effectively leverage background knowledge (e.g., documents) when conversing with humans.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Dependency-driven Relation Extraction with Attentive Graph Convolutional Networks,"Syntactic information, especially dependency trees, has been widely used by existing studies to improve relation extraction with better semantic guidance for analyzing the context information associated with the given entities. However, most existing studies suffer from the noise in the dependency trees, especially when they are automatically generated, so that intensively leveraging dependency information may introduce confusions to relation classification and necessary pruning is of great importance in this task. In this paper, we propose a dependency-driven approach for relation extraction with attentive graph convolutional networks (A-GCN). In this approach, an attention mechanism upon graph convolutional networks is applied to different contextual words in the dependency tree obtained from an offthe-shelf dependency parser, to distinguish the importance of different word dependencies. Consider that dependency types among words also contain important contextual guidance, which is potentially helpful for relation extraction, we also include the type information in A-GCN modeling. Experimental results on two English benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A-GCN, which outperforms previous studies and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on both datasets. 1 * Equal contribution.","{'sequence': 'Syntactic information, especially dependency trees, has been widely used by existing studies to improve relation extraction with better semantic guidance for analyzing the context information associated with the given entities.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Evaluating Entity Disambiguation and the Role of Popularity in Retrieval-Based NLP,"Retrieval is a core component for open-domain NLP tasks. In open-domain tasks, multiple entities can share a name, making disambiguation an inherent yet under-explored problem. We propose an evaluation benchmark for assessing the entity disambiguation capabilities of these retrievers, which we call Ambiguous Entity Retrieval (AmbER) sets. We define an AmbER set as a collection of entities that share a name along with queries about those entities. By covering the set of entities for polysemous names, AmbER sets act as a challenging test of entity disambiguation. We create AmbER sets for three popular open-domain tasks: fact checking, slot filling, and question answering, and evaluate a diverse set of retrievers. We find that the retrievers exhibit popularity bias, significantly under-performing on rarer entities that share a name, e.g., they are twice as likely to retrieve erroneous documents on queries for the less popular entity under the same name.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Claim Matching Beyond English to Scale Global Fact-Checking,"Manual fact-checking does not scale well to serve the needs of the internet. This issue is further compounded in non-English contexts. In this paper, we discuss claim matching as a possible solution to scale fact-checking. We define claim matching as the task of identifying pairs of textual messages containing claims that can be served with one fact-check. We construct a novel dataset of WhatsApp tipline and public group messages alongside fact-checked claims that are first annotated for containing ""claim-like statements"" and then matched with potentially similar items and annotated for claim matching. Our dataset contains content in high-resource (English, Hindi) and lower-resource (Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil) languages. We train our own embedding model using knowledge distillation and a high-quality ""teacher"" model in order to address the imbalance in embedding quality between the low-and high-resource languages in our dataset. We provide evaluations on the performance of our solution and compare with baselines and existing state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models, namely LASER and LaBSE.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,SemFace: Pre-training Encoder and Decoder with a Semantic Interface for Neural Machine Translation,"While pre-training techniques are working very well in natural language processing, how to pre-train a decoder and effectively leverage it for neural machine translation (NMT) still remains a tricky issue. The main reason is that the cross-attention module between the encoder and decoder cannot be pre-trained, and the combined encoder-decoder model cannot work well in the fine-tuning stage because the inputs of the decoder cross-attention come from unknown encoder outputs. In this paper, we propose a better pre-training method for NMT by defining a semantic interface (SemFace) between the pre-trained encoder and the pre-trained decoder. Specifically, we propose two types of semantic interfaces, including CL-SemFace which regards cross-lingual embeddings as an interface, and VQ-SemFace which employs vector quantized embeddings to constrain the encoder outputs and decoder inputs in the same language-independent space. We conduct massive experiments on six supervised translation pairs and three unsupervised pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Sem-Face can effectively connect the pre-trained encoder and decoder, and achieves significant improvement by 3.7 and 1.5 BLEU points on the two tasks respectively compared with previous pre-training-based NMT models. * Contribution during internship at MSRA.","{'sequence': 'While pre-training techniques are working very well in natural language processing, how to pre-train a decoder and effectively leverage it for neural machine translation (NMT) still remains a tricky issue.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Syntax-augmented Multilingual BERT for Cross-lingual Transfer,"In recent years, we have seen a colossal effort in pre-training multilingual text encoders using large-scale corpora in many languages to facilitate cross-lingual transfer learning. However, due to typological differences across languages, the cross-lingual transfer is challenging. Nevertheless, language syntax, e.g., syntactic dependencies, can bridge the typological gap. Previous works have shown that pretrained multilingual encoders, such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , capture language syntax, helping cross-lingual transfer. This work shows that explicitly providing language syntax and training mBERT using an auxiliary objective to encode the universal dependency tree structure helps cross-lingual transfer. We perform rigorous experiments on four NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, named entity recognition, and taskoriented semantic parsing. The experiment results show that syntax-augmented mBERT improves cross-lingual transfer on popular benchmarks, such as PAWS-X and MLQA, by 1.4 and 1.6 points on average across all languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,How to Adapt Your Pretrained Multilingual Model to 1600 Languages,"Pretrained multilingual models (PMMs) enable zero-shot learning via cross-lingual transfer, performing best for languages seen during pretraining.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of existing methods to adapt PMMs to new languages using a resource available for over 1600 languages: the New Testament. This is challenging for two reasons: (1) the small corpus size, and (2) the narrow domain. While performance drops for all approaches, we surprisingly still see gains of up to 17.69% accuracy for part-ofspeech tagging and 6.29 F1 for NER on average over all languages as compared to XLM-R. Another unexpected finding is that continued pretraining, the simplest approach, performs best.

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",Weakly Supervised Named Entity Tagging with Learnable Logical Rules,"We study the problem of building entity tagging systems by using a few rules as weak supervision. Previous methods mostly focus on disambiguating entity types based on contexts and expert-provided rules, while assuming entity spans are given. In this work, we propose a novel method TALLOR that bootstraps high-quality logical rules to train a neural tagger in a fully automated manner. Specifically, we introduce compound rules that are composed from simple rules to increase the precision of boundary detection and generate more diverse pseudo labels. We further design a dynamic label selection strategy to ensure pseudo label quality and therefore avoid overfitting the neural tagger. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other weakly supervised methods and even rivals a state-of-the-art distantly supervised tagger with a lexicon of over 2,000 terms when starting from only 20 simple rules. Our method can serve as a tool for rapidly building taggers in emerging domains and tasks. Case studies show that learned rules can potentially explain the predicted entities. * Work done during an internship at Bosch Research. induce new rule If TokenString(x)==""Dallas"", then Label(x)=""Location"" Ryn lives in Dallas.

Generation,Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation,"Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which we call the prefix. Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting for language models, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were ""virtual tokens"". We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-totext generation and to BART for summarization. We show that by modifying only 0.1% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics that are unseen during training.","{'sequence': 'Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks.

Generation,One2Set: Generating Diverse Keyphrases as a Set,"Recently, the sequence-to-sequence models have made remarkable progress on the task of keyphrase generation (KG) by concatenating multiple keyphrases in a predefined order as a target sequence during training. However, the keyphrases are inherently an unordered set rather than an ordered sequence. Imposing a predefined order will introduce wrong bias during training, which can highly penalize shifts in the order between keyphrases. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm ONE2SET without predefining an order to concatenate the keyphrases. To fit this paradigm, we propose a novel model that utilizes a fixed set of learned control codes as conditions to generate a set of keyphrases in parallel. To solve the problem that there is no correspondence between each prediction and target during training, we propose a K-step target assignment mechanism via bipartite matching, which greatly increases the diversity and reduces the duplication ratio of generated keyphrases. The experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","{'sequence': 'Recently, the sequence-to-sequence models have made remarkable progress on the task of keyphrase generation (KG) by concatenating multiple keyphrases in a predefined order as a target sequence during training.

Summarization,TWAG: A Topic-Guided Wikipedia Abstract Generator,"Wikipedia abstract generation aims to distill a Wikipedia abstract from web sources and has met significant success by adopting multidocument summarization techniques. However, previous works generally view the abstract as plain text, ignoring the fact that it is a description of a certain entity and can be decomposed into different topics. In this paper, we propose a two-stage model TWAG that guides the abstract generation with topical information. First, we detect the topic of each input paragraph with a classifier trained on existing Wikipedia articles to divide input documents into different topics. Then, we predict the topic distribution of each abstract sentence, and decode the sentence from topic-aware representations with a Pointer-Generator network. We evaluate our model on the Wi-kiCatSum dataset, and the results show that TWAG outperforms various existing baselines and is capable of generating comprehensive abstracts.

Question Answering,Towards Visual Question Answering on Pathology Images,"Pathology imaging is broadly used for identifying the causes and effects of diseases or injuries. Given a pathology image, being able to answer questions about the clinical findings contained in the image is very important for medical decision making. In this paper, we aim to develop a pathological visual question answering framework to analyze pathology images and answer medical questions related to these images. To build such a framework, we create PathVQA, a pathology VQA dataset with 32,795 questions asked from 4,998 pathology images. We also propose a three-level optimization framework which performs self-supervised pretraining and VQA finetuning end-to-end to learn powerful visual and textual representations jointly and automatically identifies and excludes noisy self-supervised examples from pretraining. We perform experiments on our created PathVQA dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Question Answering,ForecastQA: A Question Answering Challenge for Event Forecasting with Temporal Text Data,"Event forecasting is a challenging, yet important task, as humans seek to constantly plan for the future. Existing automated forecasting studies rely mostly on structured data, such as time-series or event-based knowledge graphs, to help predict future events. In this work, we aim to formulate a task, construct a dataset, and provide benchmarks for developing methods for event forecasting with large volumes of unstructured text data. To simulate the forecasting scenario on temporal news documents, we formulate the problem as a restricted-domain, multiple-choice, question-answering (QA) task. Unlike existing QA tasks, our task limits accessible information, and thus a model has to make a forecasting judgement. To showcase the usefulness of this task formulation, we introduce FORECASTQA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 10,392 event forecasting questions, which have been collected and verified via crowdsourcing efforts. We present our experiments on FORECASTQA using BERTbased models and find that our best model achieves 61.0% accuracy on the dataset, which still lags behind human performance by about 19%. We hope FORECASTQA will support future research efforts in bridging this gap. 1","{'sequence': 'Event forecasting is a challenging, yet important task, as humans seek to constantly plan for the future.

Question Answering,Recursive Tree-Structured Self-Attention for Answer Sentence Selection,"Syntactic structure is an important component of natural language text. Recent topperforming models in Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) use self-attention and transfer learning, but not syntactic structure. Tree structures have shown strong performance in tasks with sentence pair input like semantic relatedness. We investigate whether tree structures can boost performance in AS2. We introduce the Tree Aggregation Transformer: a novel recursive, tree-structured self-attention model for AS2. The recursive nature of our model is able to represent all levels of syntactic parse trees with only one additional self-attention layer. Without transfer learning, we establish a new state of the art on the popular TrecQA and WikiQA benchmark datasets. Additionally, we evaluate our method on four Community Question Answering datasets, and find that tree-structured representations have limitations with noisy user-generated text. We conduct probing experiments to evaluate how our models leverage tree structures across datasets.

Information Extraction,How Knowledge Graph and Attention Help? A Qualitative Analysis into Bag-level Relation Extraction,"Knowledge Graph (KG) and attention mechanism have been demonstrated effective in introducing and selecting useful information for weakly supervised methods. However, only qualitative analysis and ablation study are provided as evidence. In this paper, we contribute a dataset and propose a paradigm to quantitatively evaluate the effect of attention and KG on bag-level relation extraction (RE). We find that (1) higher attention accuracy may lead to worse performance as it may harm the model's ability to extract entity mention features; (2) the performance of attention is largely influenced by various noise distribution patterns, which is closely related to real-world datasets; (3) KG-enhanced attention indeed improves RE performance, while not through enhanced attention but by incorporating entity prior; and (4) attention mechanism may exacerbate the issue of insufficient training data. Based on these findings, we show that a straightforward variant of RE model can achieve significant improvements (6% AUC on average) on two real-world datasets as compared with three state-of-the-art baselines.

Information Extraction,Trigger is Not Sufficient: Exploiting Frame-aware Knowledge for Implicit Event Argument Extraction,"Implicit Event Argument Extraction seeks to identify arguments that play direct or implicit roles in a given event. However, most prior works focus on capturing direct relations between arguments and the event trigger. The lack of reasoning ability brings many challenges to the extraction of implicit arguments. In this work, we present a Frame-aware Event Argument Extraction (FEAE) learning framework to tackle this issue through reasoning in event frame-level scope. The proposed method leverages related arguments of the expected one as clues to guide the reasoning process. To bridge the gap between oracle knowledge used in the training phase and the imperfect related arguments in the test stage, we further introduce a curriculum knowledge distillation strategy to drive a final model that could operate without extra inputs through mimicking the behavior of a well-informed teacher model.

Information Extraction,Explicitly Capturing Relations between Entity Mentions via Graph Neural Networks for Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER) is well studied for the general domain, and recent systems have achieved human-level performance for identifying common entity types. However, the NER performance is still moderate for specialized domains that tend to feature complicated contexts and jargonistic entity types. To address these challenges, we propose explicitly connecting entity mentions based on both global coreference relations and local dependency relations for building better entity mention representations. In our experiments, we incorporate entity mention relations by Graph Neural Networks and show that our system noticeably improves the NER performance on two datasets from different domains. We further show that the proposed lightweight system can effectively elevate the NER performance to a higher level even when only a tiny amount of labeled data is available, which is desirable for domain-specific NER. 1","{'sequence': 'Named entity recognition (NER) is well studied for the general domain, and recent systems have achieved human-level performance for identifying common entity types.

Information Extraction,AdaTag: Multi-Attribute Value Extraction from Product Profiles with Adaptive Decoding,"Automatic extraction of product attribute values is an important enabling technology in e-Commerce platforms. This task is usually modeled using sequence labeling architectures, with several extensions to handle multi-attribute extraction. One line of previous work constructs attribute-specific models, through separate decoders or entirely separate models. However, this approach constrains knowledge sharing across different attributes. Other contributions use a single multiattribute model, with different techniques to embed attribute information. But sharing the entire network parameters across all attributes can limit the model's capacity to capture attribute-specific characteristics. In this paper we present AdaTag, which uses adaptive decoding to handle extraction. We parameterize the decoder with pretrained attribute embeddings, through a hypernetwork and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. This allows for separate, but semantically correlated, decoders to be generated on the fly for different attributes.

Information Extraction,Benchmarking Scalable Methods for Streaming Cross Document Entity Coreference,"Streaming cross document entity coreference (CDC) systems disambiguate mentions of named entities in a scalable manner via incremental clustering. Unlike other approaches for named entity disambiguation (e.g., entity linking), streaming CDC allows for the disambiguation of entities that are unknown at inference time. Thus, it is well-suited for processing streams of data where new entities are frequently introduced. Despite these benefits, this task is currently difficult to study, as existing approaches are either evaluated on datasets that are no longer available, or omit other crucial details needed to ensure fair comparison. In this work, we address this issue by compiling a large benchmark adapted from existing free datasets, and performing a comprehensive evaluation of a number of novel and existing baseline models. 1 We investigate: how to best encode mentions, which clustering algorithms are most effective for grouping mentions, how models transfer to different domains, and how bounding the number of mentions tracked during inference impacts performance. Our results show that the relative performance of neural and feature-based mention encoders varies across different domains, and in most cases the best performance is achieved using a combination of both approaches. We also find that performance is minimally impacted by limiting the number of tracked mentions.","{'sequence': 'Streaming cross document entity coreference (CDC) systems disambiguate mentions of named entities in a scalable manner via incremental clustering.

We also find that performance is minimally impacted by limiting the number of tracked mentions.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.08121665567159653, 0.07236030697822571, 0.06243603304028511, 0.05837120860815048, 0.05361951142549515, 0.05173565819859505, 0.051488012075424194, 0.05092298611998558, 0.048766929656267166, 0.046963971108198166, 0.04261390119791031, 0.039134323596954346, 0.038866590708494186, 0.037775516510009766, 0.036896176636219025, 0.03596116974949837, 0.03426576778292656, 0.03355073928833008, 0.03315348923206329, 0.02593706175684929, 0.02307003177702427, 0.022556817159056664, 0.018337136134505272]}",0.08121665567159653,Question Answering,0.05092298611998558
Information Extraction,Search from History and Reason for Future: Two-stage Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs,"Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) have been developed and used in many different areas. Reasoning on TKGs that predicts potential facts (events) in the future brings great challenges to existing models. When facing a prediction task, human beings usually search useful historical information (i.e., clues) in their memories and then reason for future meticulously. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose CluSTeR to predict future facts in a two-stage manner, Clue Searching and Temporal Reasoning, accordingly. Specifically, at the clue searching stage, CluSTeR learns a beam search policy via reinforcement learning (RL) to induce multiple clues from historical facts. At the temporal reasoning stage, it adopts a graph convolution network based sequence method to deduce answers from clues. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the substantial advantages of CluSTeR compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the clues found by CluSTeR further provide interpretability for the results.","{'sequence': 'Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) have been developed and used in many different areas.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Learning Span-Level Interactions for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction,"Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the most recent subtask of ABSA which outputs triplets of an aspect target, its associated sentiment, and the corresponding opinion term. Recent models perform the triplet extraction in an end-to-end manner but heavily rely on the interactions between each target word and opinion word. Thereby, they cannot perform well on targets and opinions which contain multiple words. Our proposed span-level approach explicitly considers the interaction between the whole spans of targets and opinions when predicting their sentiment relation. Thus, it can make predictions with the semantics of whole spans, ensuring better sentiment consistency. To ease the high computational cost caused by span enumeration, we propose a dual-channel span pruning strategy by incorporating supervision from the Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and Opinion Term Extraction (OTE) tasks. This strategy not only improves computational efficiency but also distinguishes the opinion and target spans more properly. Our framework simultaneously achieves strong performance for the ASTE as well as ATE and OTE tasks.

Although recent works have achieved substantial progress, most of them focus on leveraging the inherent constraints or incorporating external knowledge for state prediction. The rich semantic relations in the given paragraph are largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel approach (REAL) to procedural text understanding, where we build a general framework to systematically model the entityentity, entity-action, and entity-location relations using a graph neural network. We further develop algorithms for graph construction, representation learning, and state and location tracking. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark datasets, ProPara, and Recipes. The experimental results show that our method outperforms strong baselines by a large margin, i.e., 5.0% on ProPara and 3.2% on Recipes, illustrating the utility of semantic relations and the effectiveness of the graph-based reasoning model.","{'sequence': 'Procedural text understanding aims at tracking the states (e.g., create, move, destroy) and locations of the entities mentioned in a given paragraph.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",From Paraphrasing to Semantic Parsing: Unsupervised Semantic Parsing via Synchronous Semantic Decoding,"Semantic parsing is challenging due to the structure gap and the semantic gap between utterances and logical forms. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised semantic parsing method -Synchronous Semantic Decoding (SSD), which can simultaneously resolve the semantic gap and the structure gap by jointly leveraging paraphrasing and grammarconstrained decoding. Specifically, we reformulate semantic parsing as a constrained paraphrasing problem: given an utterance, our model synchronously generates its canonical utterance 1 and meaning representation. During synchronous decoding: the utterance paraphrasing is constrained by the structure of the logical form, therefore the canonical utterance can be paraphrased controlledly; the semantic decoding is guided by the semantics of the canonical utterance, therefore its logical form can be generated unsupervisedly.

Most of PLMs follow the default setting of architecture hyper-parameters (e.g., the hidden dimension is a quarter of the intermediate dimension in feed-forward sub-networks) in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Few studies have been conducted to explore the design of architecture hyper-parameters in BERT, especially for the more efficient PLMs with tiny sizes, which are essential for practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we adopt the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically search architecture hyper-parameters.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Code Generation from Natural Language with Less Prior Knowledge and More Monolingual Data,"Training datasets for semantic parsing are typically small due to the higher expertise required for annotation than most other NLP tasks. As a result, models for this application usually need additional prior knowledge to be built into the architecture or algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a new framework with a two-branch Siamese Network which maximizes the similarity between two augmented views of each sentence.

Meanwhile, the target network branch is bootstrapped with a moving average of the online network. The proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on semantic textual similarity (STS) and classification tasks.

Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Word Sense Disambiguation: Towards Interactive Context Exploitation from Both Word and Sense Perspectives,"Lately proposed Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems have approached the estimated upper bound of the task on standard evaluation benchmarks. However, these systems typically implement the disambiguation of words in a document almost independently, underutilizing sense and word dependency in context. In this paper, we convert the nearly isolated decisions into interrelated ones by exposing senses in context when learning sense embeddings in a similaritybased Sense Aware Context Exploitation (SACE) architecture. Meanwhile, we enhance the context embedding learning with selected sentences from the same document, rather than utilizing only the sentence where each ambiguous word appears. Experiments on both English and multilingual WSD datasets have shown the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by large margins (3.7% and 1.2% respectively), especially on few-shot (14.3%) and zero-shot (35.9%) scenarios.","{'sequence': 'Lately proposed Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems have approached the estimated upper bound of the task on standard evaluation benchmarks.

Through experiments on the English FrameNet data, we demonstrate that using the masked word embeddings is effective for avoiding too much reliance on the surface information of frameevoking verbs and that two-step clustering can improve the number of resulting frame clusters for the instances of the same verb.', 'labels': ['Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'NLP Applications', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Generation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0878913551568985, 0.07984007894992828, 0.06445977836847305, 0.056089214980602264, 0.05249880999326706, 0.0521455854177475, 0.05022018402814865, 0.048241641372442245, 0.048136916011571884, 0.04423770308494568, 0.04049927741289139, 0.040187444537878036, 0.04016580432653427, 0.038227517157793045, 0.036838412284851074, 0.036612220108509064, 0.03635371848940849, 0.03285578265786171, 0.02745554968714714, 0.02598881721496582, 0.025594688951969147, 0.01836889237165451, 0.017090579494833946]}",0.0878913551568985,"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",0.06445977836847305

We conduct experiments on the Flickr8k spoken caption dataset in addition to a novel corpus of spoken audio captions collected for the popular MSCOCO dataset, demonstrating that our generated captions also capture diverse visual semantics of the images they describe.

Speech and Multimodality,CTFN: Hierarchical Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Using Coupled-Translation Fusion Network,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is the challenging research area that attends to the fusion of multiple heterogeneous modalities. The main challenge is the occurrence of some missing modalities during the multimodal fusion procedure. However, the existing techniques require all modalities as input, thus are sensitive to missing modalities at predicting time. In this work, the coupled-translation fusion network (CTFN) is firstly proposed to model bi-direction interplay via couple learning, ensuring the robustness in respect to missing modalities. Specifically, the cyclic consistency constraint is presented to improve the translation performance, allowing us directly to discard decoder and only embraces encoder of Transformer. This could contribute to a much lighter model. Due to the couple learning, CTFN is able to conduct bi-direction crossmodality intercorrelation parallelly. Based on CTFN, a hierarchical architecture is further established to exploit multiple bi-direction translations, leading to double multimodal fusing embeddings compared with traditional translation methods. Moreover, the convolution block is utilized to further highlight explicit interactions among those translations. For evaluation, CTFN was verified on two multimodal benchmarks with extensive ablation studies. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art or often competitive performance. Additionally, CTFN still maintains robustness when considering missing modality.","{'sequence': 'Multimodal sentiment analysis is the challenging research area that attends to the fusion of multiple heterogeneous modalities.

Speech and Multimodality,Lightweight Adapter Tuning for Multilingual Speech Translation,"Adapter modules were recently introduced as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning in NLP. Adapter tuning consists in freezing pretrained parameters of a model and injecting lightweight modules between layers, resulting in the addition of only a small number of taskspecific trainable parameters. While adapter tuning was investigated for multilingual neural machine translation, this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of adapters for multilingual speech translation (ST). Starting from different pre-trained models (a multilingual ST trained on parallel data or a multilingual BART (mBART) trained on non-parallel multilingual data), we show that adapters can be used to: (a) efficiently specialize ST to specific language pairs with a low extra cost in terms of parameters, and (b) transfer from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task and an mBART pretrained model to a multilingual ST task. Experiments show that adapter tuning offer competitive results to full fine-tuning, while being much more parameter-efficient.","{'sequence': 'Adapter modules were recently introduced as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning in NLP.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Parameter Selection: Why We Should Pay More Attention to It,"The importance of parameter selection in supervised learning is well known. However, due to the many parameter combinations, an incomplete or an insufficient procedure is often applied. This situation may cause misleading or confusing conclusions. In this opinion paper, through an intriguing example we point out that the seriousness goes beyond what is generally recognized. In the topic of multilabel classification for medical code prediction, one influential paper conducted a proper parameter selection on a set, but when moving to a subset of frequently occurring labels, the authors used the same parameters without a separate tuning. The set of frequent labels became a popular benchmark in subsequent studies, which kept pushing the state of the art. However, we discovered that most of the results in these studies cannot surpass the approach in the original paper if a parameter tuning had been conducted at the time. Thus it is unclear how much progress the subsequent developments have actually brought. The lesson clearly indicates that without enough attention on parameter selection, the research progress in our field can be uncertain or even illusive.","{'sequence': 'The importance of parameter selection in supervised learning is well known.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Positional Artefacts Propagate Through Masked Language Model Embeddings,"In this work, we demonstrate that the contextualized word vectors derived from pretrained masked language model-based encoders share a common, perhaps undesirable pattern across layers. Namely, we find cases of persistent outlier neurons within BERT and RoBERTa's hidden state vectors that consistently bear the smallest or largest values in said vectors. In an attempt to investigate the source of this information, we introduce a neuron-level analysis method, which reveals that the outliers are closely related to information captured by positional embeddings. We also pre-train the RoBERTa-base models from scratch and find that the outliers disappear without using positional embeddings. These outliers, we find, are the major cause of anisotropy of encoders' raw vector spaces, and clipping them leads to increased similarity across vectors. We demonstrate this in practice by showing that clipped vectors can more accurately distinguish word senses, as well as lead to better sentence embeddings when mean pooling.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Language Model Evaluation Beyond Perplexity,"We propose an alternate approach to quantifying how well language models learn natural language: we ask how well they match the statistical tendencies of natural language. To answer this question, we analyze whether text generated from language models exhibits the statistical tendencies present in the humangenerated text on which they were trained. We provide a framework-paired with significance tests-for evaluating the fit of language models to these trends. We find that neural language models appear to learn only a subset of the tendencies considered, but align much more closely with empirical trends than proposed theoretical distributions (when present). Further, the fit to different distributions is highly-dependent on both model architecture and generation strategy.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Learning to Explain: Generating Stable Explanations Fast,"The importance of explaining the outcome of a machine learning model, especially a blackbox model, is widely acknowledged. Recent approaches explain an outcome by identifying the contributions of input features to this outcome. In environments involving large blackbox models or complex inputs, this leads to computationally demanding algorithms. Further, these algorithms often suffer from low stability, with explanations varying significantly across similar examples. In this paper, we propose a Learning to Explain (L2E) approach that learns the behaviour of an underlying explanation algorithm simultaneously from all training examples. Once the explanation algorithm is distilled into an explainer network, it can be used to explain new instances. Our experiments on three classification tasks, which compare our approach to six explanation algorithms, show that L2E is between 5 and 7.5 × 10 4 times faster than these algorithms, while generating more stable explanations, and having comparable faithfulness to the black-box model.","{'sequence': 'The importance of explaining the outcome of a machine learning model, especially a blackbox model, is widely acknowledged.

Our experiments on three classification tasks, which compare our approach to six explanation algorithms, show that L2E is between 5 and 7.5 × 10 4 times faster than these algorithms, while generating more stable explanations, and having comparable faithfulness to the black-box model.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09804961830377579, 0.08781066536903381, 0.08716535568237305, 0.06774482131004333, 0.053973276168107986, 0.0508715845644474, 0.049282707273960114, 0.04717569053173065, 0.0461418442428112, 0.04495774954557419, 0.040074434131383896, 0.03929316997528076, 0.03646358847618103, 0.03599155694246292, 0.03390355780720711, 0.02961876057088375, 0.02751617133617401, 0.025969306007027626, 0.024874089285731316, 0.019785089418292046, 0.01848994754254818, 0.01804177090525627, 0.01680525578558445]}",0.09804961830377579,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.040074434131383896
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,StereoSet: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models,"A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people, e.g., Asians are good at math or African Americans are athletic. Such beliefs (biases) are known to hurt target groups. Since pretrained language models are trained on large real world data, they are known to capture stereotypical biases. It is important to quantify to what extent these biases are present in them. Although this is a rapidly growing area of research, existing literature lacks in two important aspects: 1) they mainly evaluate bias of pretrained language models on a small set of artificial sentences, even though these models are trained on natural data; 2) current evaluations focus on measuring bias without considering the language modeling ability of a model, which could lead to misleading trust on a model even if it is a poor language model. We address both these problems. We present StereoSet, a large-scale natural English dataset to measure stereotypical biases in four domains: gender, profession, race, and religion. We contrast both stereotypical bias and language modeling ability of popular models like BERT, GPT2, ROBERTA, and XLNET. We show that these models exhibit strong stereotypical biases. Our data and code are available at https://stereoset. mit.edu.","{'sequence': 'A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people, e.g., Asians are good at math or African Americans are athletic.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Alignment Rationale for Natural Language Inference,"Deep learning models have achieved great success on the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), though only a few attempts try to explain their behaviors. Existing explanation methods usually pick prominent features such as words or phrases from the input text. However, for NLI, alignments among words or phrases are more enlightening clues to explain the model. To this end, this paper presents AREC, a post-hoc approach to generate alignment rationale explanations for co-attention based models in NLI. The explanation is based on feature selection, which keeps few but sufficient alignments while maintaining the same prediction of the target model. Experimental results show that our method is more faithful and readable compared with many existing approaches.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Enabling Lightweight Fine-tuning for Pre-trained Language Model Compression based on Matrix Product Operators,"This paper presents a novel pre-trained language models (PLM) compression approach based on the matrix product operator (short as MPO) from quantum many-body physics. It can decompose an original matrix into central tensors (containing the core information) and auxiliary tensors (with only a small proportion of parameters). With the decomposed MPO structure, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy by only updating the parameters from the auxiliary tensors, and design an optimization algorithm for MPO-based approximation over stacked network architectures. Our approach can be applied to the original or the compressed PLMs in a general way, which derives a lighter network and significantly reduces the parameters to be fine-tuned.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Syntax-Enhanced Pre-trained Model,"We study the problem of leveraging the syntactic structure of text to enhance pre-trained models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Existing methods utilize syntax of text either in the pre-training stage or in the fine-tuning stage, so that they suffer from discrepancy between the two stages. Such a problem would lead to the necessity of having human-annotated syntactic information, which limits the application of existing methods to broader scenarios. To address this, we present a model that utilizes the syntax of text in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Our model is based on Transformer with a syntax-aware attention layer that considers the dependency tree of the text. We further introduce a new pre-training task of predicting the syntactic distance among tokens in the dependency tree. We evaluate the model on three downstream tasks, including relation classification, entity typing, and question answering. Results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmark datasets. We have two major findings. First, we demonstrate that infusing automatically produced syntax of text improves pre-trained models. Second, global syntactic distances among tokens bring larger performance gains compared to local head relations between contiguous tokens. 1 * Work is done during internship at Microsoft. † For questions, please contact D.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Matching Distributions between Model and Data: Cross-domain Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge of source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing methods typically require to learn to adapt the target model by exploiting the source data and sharing the network architecture across domains. However, this pipeline makes the source data risky and is inflexible for deploying the target model. This paper tackles a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and different network architectures can be adapted for target domain in terms of deployment environments. We propose a generic framework named Crossdomain Knowledge Distillation (CdKD) without needing any source data. CdKD matches the joint distributions between a trained source model and a set of target data during distilling the knowledge from the source model to the target domain.

Existing methods typically require to learn to adapt the target model by exploiting the source data and sharing the network architecture across domains. However, this pipeline makes the source data risky and is inflexible for deploying the target model. This paper tackles a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and different network architectures can be adapted for target domain in terms of deployment environments. We propose a generic framework named Crossdomain Knowledge Distillation (CdKD) without needing any source data.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Counterfactual Inference for Text Classification Debiasing,"Today's text classifiers inevitably suffer from unintended dataset biases, especially the document-level label bias and word-level keyword bias, which may hurt models' generalization. Many previous studies employed datalevel manipulations or model-level balancing mechanisms to recover unbiased distributions and thus prevent models from capturing the two types of biases. Unfortunately, they either suffer from the extra cost of data collection/selection/annotation or need an elaborate design of balancing strategies. Different from traditional factual inference in which debiasing occurs before or during training, counterfactual inference mitigates the influence brought by unintended confounders after training, which can make unbiased decisions with biased observations. Inspired by this, we propose a model-agnostic text classification debiasing framework -CORSAIR, which can effectively avoid employing data manipulations or designing balancing mechanisms. Concretely, CORSAIR first trains a base model on a training set directly, allowing the dataset biases ""poison"" the trained model. In inference, given a factual input document, COR-SAIR imagines its two counterfactual counterparts to distill and mitigate the two biases captured by the poisonous model. Extensive experiments demonstrate CORSAIR's effectiveness, generalizability and fairness. 1 * This work was partly done during Chen Qian's internship at Alibaba DAMO academy.","{'sequence': 'Today\'s text classifiers inevitably suffer from unintended dataset biases, especially the document-level label bias and word-level keyword bias, which may hurt models\' generalization.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,HieRec: Hierarchical User Interest Modeling for Personalized News Recommendation,"User interest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation. Existing news recommendation methods usually learn a single user embedding for each user from their previous behaviors to represent their overall interest. However, user interest is usually diverse and multi-grained, which is difficult to be accurately modeled by a single user embedding. In this paper, we propose a news recommendation method with hierarchical user interest modeling, named HieRec. Instead of a single user embedding, in our method each user is represented in a hierarchical interest tree to better capture their diverse and multi-grained interest in news. We use a three-level hierarchy to represent 1) overall user interest; 2) user interest in coarse-grained topics like sports; and 3) user interest in fine-grained topics like football. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical user interest matching framework to match candidate news with different levels of user interest for more accurate user interest targeting.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,PP-Rec: News Recommendation with Personalized User Interest and Time-aware News Popularity,"Personalized news recommendation methods are widely used in online news services. These methods usually recommend news based on the matching between news content and user interest inferred from historical behaviors. However, these methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to cold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have read. In general, popular news usually contain important information and can attract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in content and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news popularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for personalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for recommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a personalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to capture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure timeaware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news content, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework. Besides, we propose a popularity-aware user encoder to eliminate the popularity bias in user behaviors for accurate interest modeling.

We propose Dirichlet Neighborhood Ensemble (DNE), a randomized method for training a robust model to defense synonym substitutionbased attacks. During training, DNE forms virtual sentences by sampling embedding vectors for each word in an input sentence from a convex hull spanned by the word and its synonyms, and it augments them with the training data. In such a way, the model is robust to adversarial attacks while maintaining the performance on the original clean data. DNE is agnostic to the network architectures and scales to large models (e.g., BERT) for NLP applications. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recently proposed defense methods by a significant margin across different network architectures and multiple data sets.","{'sequence': 'Although deep neural networks have achieved prominent performance on many NLP tasks, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Machine Learning for NLP,Shortformer: Better Language Modeling using Shorter Inputs,"Increasing the input length has been a driver of progress in language modeling with transformers. We identify conditions where shorter inputs are not harmful, and achieve perplexity and efficiency improvements through two new methods that decrease input length. First, we show that initially training a model on short subsequences before moving on to longer ones both reduces overall training time and, surprisingly, substantially improves perplexity. Second, we show how to improve the efficiency of recurrence methods in transformers, which let models condition on previously processed tokens when generating sequences that exceed the maximal length the transformer can handle at once. Existing methods require computationally expensive relative position embeddings; we introduce a simple alternative of adding absolute position embeddings to queries and keys instead of to word embeddings, which efficiently produces superior results. We show that these recurrent models also benefit from short input lengths. Combining these techniques speeds up training by a factor of 1.65, reduces memory usage, and substantially improves perplexity on WikiText-103, without adding any parameters. 1","{'sequence': 'Increasing the input length has been a driver of progress in language modeling with transformers.

Machine Learning for NLP,De-Confounded Variational Encoder-Decoder for Logical Table-to-Text Generation,"Logical table-to-text generation aims to automatically generate fluent and logically faithful text from tables. The task remains challenging where deep learning models often generated linguistically fluent but logically inconsistent text. The underlying reason may be that deep learning models often capture surface-level spurious correlations rather than the causal relationships between the table x and the sentence y. Specifically, in the training stage, a model can get a low empirical loss without understanding x and use spurious statistical cues instead. In this paper, we propose a de-confounded variational encoder-decoder (DCVED) based on causal intervention, learning the objective p(y|do(x)). Firstly, we propose to use variational inference to estimate the confounders in the latent space and cooperate with the causal intervention based on Pearl's do-calculus to alleviate the spurious correlations. Secondly, to make the latent confounder meaningful, we propose a backprediction process to predict the not-used entities but linguistically similar to the exactly selected ones. Finally, since our variational model can generate multiple candidates, we train a table-text selector to find out the best candidate sentence for the given table.

To address this issue, we first propose two additional stealthiness-based metrics to make the backdoor attacking evaluation more credible. We further propose a novel word-based backdoor attacking method based on negative data augmentation and modifying word embeddings, making an important step towards achieving stealthy backdoor attacking.

Machine Learning for NLP,Crowdsourcing Learning as Domain Adaptation: A Case Study on Named Entity Recognition,"Crowdsourcing is regarded as one prospective solution for effective supervised learning, aiming to build large-scale annotated training data by crowd workers. Previous studies focus on reducing the influences from the noises of the crowdsourced annotations for supervised models. We take a different point in this work, regarding all crowdsourced annotations as goldstandard with respect to the individual annotators. In this way, we find that crowdsourcing could be highly similar to domain adaptation, and then the recent advances of cross-domain methods can be almost directly applied to crowdsourcing. Here we take named entity recognition (NER) as a study case, suggesting an annotator-aware representation learning model that inspired by the domain adaptation methods which attempt to capture effective domain-aware features. We investigate both unsupervised and supervised crowdsourcing learning, assuming that no or only smallscale expert annotations are available. Experimental results on a benchmark crowdsourced NER dataset show that our method is highly effective, leading to a new state-of-the-art performance. In addition, under the supervised setting, we can achieve impressive performance gains with only a very small scale of expert annotations.","{'sequence': 'Crowdsourcing is regarded as one prospective solution for effective supervised learning, aiming to build large-scale annotated training data by crowd workers.

Machine Learning for NLP,Robust Transfer Learning with Pretrained Language Models through Adapters,"Transfer learning with large pretrained transformer-based language models like BERT has become a dominating approach for most NLP tasks. Simply fine-tuning those large language models on downstream tasks or combining it with task-specific pretraining is often not robust. In particular, the performance considerably varies as the random seed changes or the number of pretraining and/or fine-tuning iterations varies, and the fine-tuned model is vulnerable to adversarial attack. We propose a simple yet effective adapter-based approach to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we insert small bottleneck layers (i.e., adapter) within each layer of a pretrained model, then fix the pretrained layers and train the adapter layers on the downstream task data, with (1) task-specific unsupervised pretraining and then (2) task-specific supervised training (e.g., classification, sequence labeling). Our experiments demonstrate that such a training scheme leads to improved stability and adversarial robustness in transfer learning to various downstream tasks. 1","{'sequence': 'Transfer learning with large pretrained transformer-based language models like BERT has become a dominating approach for most NLP tasks.

In this paper, we explore the option of training directly on the estimated label distribution of the annotators in the NLI task, using a learning loss based on this ambiguity distribution instead of the goldlabels. We prepare AmbiNLI, a trial dataset obtained from readily available sources, and show it is possible to reduce ChaosNLI divergence scores when finetuning on this data, a promising first step towards learning how to capture linguistic ambiguity.

Machine Learning for NLP,Exploring Distantly-Labeled Rationales in Neural Network Models,"Recent studies strive to incorporate various human rationales into neural networks to improve model performance, but few pay attention to the quality of the rationales. Most existing methods distribute their models' focus to distantly-labeled rationale words entirely and equally, while ignoring the potential important non-rationale words and not distinguishing the importance of different rationale words. In this paper, we propose two novel auxiliary loss functions to make better use of distantly-labeled rationales, which encourage models to maintain their focus on important words beyond labeled rationales (PINs) and alleviate redundant training on non-helpful rationales (NoIRs). Experiments on two representative classification tasks show that our proposed methods can push a classification model to effectively learn crucial clues from nonperfect rationales while maintaining the ability to spread its focus to other unlabeled important words, thus significantly outperform existing methods.","{'sequence': ""Recent studies strive to incorporate various human rationales into neural networks to improve model performance, but few pay attention to the quality of the rationales.

Machine Learning for NLP,Learning to Perturb Word Embeddings for Out-of-distribution QA,"QA models based on pretrained language models have achieved remarkable performance on various benchmark datasets. However, QA models do not generalize well to unseen data that falls outside the training distribution, due to distributional shifts. Data augmentation (DA) techniques which drop/replace words have shown to be effective in regularizing the model from overfitting to the training data. Yet, they may adversely affect the QA tasks since they incur semantic changes that may lead to wrong answers for the QA task. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet effective DA method based on a stochastic noise generator, which learns to perturb the word embedding of the input questions and context without changing their semantics. We validate the performance of the QA models trained with our word embedding perturbation on a single source dataset, on five different target domains. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline DA methods. Notably, the model trained with ours outperforms the model trained with more than 240K artificially generated QA pairs.","{'sequence': 'QA models based on pretrained language models have achieved remarkable performance on various benchmark datasets.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Maria: A Visual Experience Powered Conversational Agent,"Arguably, the visual perception of conversational agents to the physical world is a key way for them to exhibit the human-like intelligence. Image-grounded conversation is thus proposed to address this challenge. Existing works focus on exploring the multimodal dialog models that ground the conversation on a given image.

Specifically, we present Maria, a neural conversation agent powered by the visual world experiences which are retrieved from a large-scale image index. Maria consists of three flexible components, i.e., text-to-image retriever, visual concept detector and visual-knowledge-grounded response generator. The retriever aims to retrieve a correlated image to the dialog from an image index, while the visual concept detector extracts rich visual knowledge from the image. Then, the response generator is grounded on the extracted visual knowledge and dialog context to generate the target response. Extensive experiments demonstrate Maria outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics and human evaluation, and can generate informative responses that have some visual commonsense of the physical world.","{'sequence': 'Arguably, the visual perception of conversational agents to the physical world is a key way for them to exhibit the human-like intelligence.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Human-machine Collaborative Framework for Evaluating Malevolence in Dialogues,"Conversational dialogue systems (CDSs) are hard to evaluate due to the complexity of natural language. Automatic evaluation of dialogues often shows insufficient correlation with human judgements. Human evaluation is reliable but labor-intensive. We introduce a human-machine collaborative framework, HMCEval, that can guarantee reliability of the evaluation outcomes with reduced human effort. HMCEval casts dialogue evaluation as a sample assignment problem, where we need to decide to assign a sample to a human or a machine for evaluation. HMCEval includes a model confidence estimation module to estimate the confidence of the predicted sample assignment, and a human effort estimation module to estimate the human effort should the sample be assigned to human evaluation, as well as a sample assignment execution module that finds the optimum assignment solution based on the estimated confidence and effort. We assess the performance of HMCEval on the task of evaluating malevolence in dialogues. The experimental results show that HMCEval achieves around 99% evaluation accuracy with half of the human effort spared, showing that HMCEval provides reliable evaluation outcomes while reducing human effort by a large amount.","{'sequence': 'Conversational dialogue systems (CDSs) are hard to evaluate due to the complexity of natural language.

HMCEval includes a model confidence estimation module to estimate the confidence of the predicted sample assignment, and a human effort estimation module to estimate the human effort should the sample be assigned to human evaluation, as well as a sample assignment execution module that finds the optimum assignment solution based on the estimated confidence and effort. We assess the performance of HMCEval on the task of evaluating malevolence in dialogues. The experimental results show that HMCEval achieves around 99% evaluation accuracy with half of the human effort spared, showing that HMCEval provides reliable evaluation outcomes while reducing human effort by a large amount.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'NLP Applications', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1180478185415268, 0.11440400779247284, 0.06906764209270477, 0.06847787648439407, 0.04994171857833862, 0.04866005852818489, 0.04467180743813515, 0.041023943573236465, 0.03808216750621796, 0.0377880334854126, 0.03396342694759369, 0.032630059868097305, 0.03219436854124069, 0.031324535608291626, 0.030066750943660736, 0.02951885014772415, 0.029306121170520782, 0.029286615550518036, 0.02811765857040882, 0.02708485908806324, 0.0264614075422287, 0.0217987559735775, 0.018081486225128174]}",0.1180478185415268,Resources and Evaluation,0.11440400779247284
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Generating Relevant and Coherent Dialogue Responses using Self-Separated Conditional Variational AutoEncoders,"Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) effectively increases the diversity and informativeness of responses in open-ended dialogue generation tasks through enriching the context vector with sampled latent variables. However, due to the inherent one-to-many and many-toone phenomena in human dialogues, the sampled latent variables may not correctly reflect the contexts' semantics, leading to irrelevant and incoherent generated responses. To resolve this problem, we propose Self-separated Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (abbreviated as SepaCVAE) that introduces group information to regularize the latent variables, which enhances CVAE by improving the responses' relevance and coherence while maintaining their diversity and informativeness. SepaCVAE actively divides the input data into groups, and then widens the absolute difference between data pairs from distinct groups, while narrowing the relative distance between data pairs in the same group. Empirical results from automatic evaluation and detailed analysis demonstrate that SepaC-VAE can significantly boost responses in wellestablished open-domain dialogue datasets.","{'sequence': ""Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) effectively increases the diversity and informativeness of responses in open-ended dialogue generation tasks through enriching the context vector with sampled latent variables.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Modeling Discriminative Representations for Out-of-Domain Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning,"Detecting Out-of-Domain (OOD) or unknown intents from user queries is essential in a taskoriented dialog system. A key challenge of OOD detection is to learn discriminative semantic features. Traditional cross-entropy loss only focuses on whether a sample is correctly classified, and does not explicitly distinguish the margins between categories. In this paper, we propose a supervised contrastive learning objective to minimize intra-class variance by pulling together in-domain intents belonging to the same class and maximize inter-class variance by pushing apart samples from different classes. Besides, we employ an adversarial augmentation mechanism to obtain pseudo diverse views of a sample in the latent space.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,On the Generation of Medical Dialogs for COVID-19,"Under the pandemic of COVID-19, people experiencing COVID19-related symptoms have a pressing need to consult doctors.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Constructing Multi-Modal Dialogue Dataset by Replacing Text with Semantically Relevant Images,"In multi-modal dialogue systems, it is important to allow the use of images as part of a multi-turn conversation. Training such dialogue systems generally requires a large-scale dataset consisting of multi-turn dialogues that involve images, but such datasets rarely exist. In response, this paper proposes a 45k multimodal dialogue dataset created with minimal human intervention. Our method to create such a dataset consists of (1) preparing and pre-processing text dialogue datasets, (2) creating image-mixed dialogues by using a textto-image replacement technique, and (3) employing a contextual-similarity-based filtering step to ensure the contextual coherence of the dataset. To evaluate the validity of our dataset, we devise a simple retrieval model for dialogue sentence prediction tasks.

Training such dialogue systems generally requires a large-scale dataset consisting of multi-turn dialogues that involve images, but such datasets rarely exist. In response, this paper proposes a 45k multimodal dialogue dataset created with minimal human intervention. Our method to create such a dataset consists of (1) preparing and pre-processing text dialogue datasets, (2) creating image-mixed dialogues by using a textto-image replacement technique, and (3) employing a contextual-similarity-based filtering step to ensure the contextual coherence of the dataset. To evaluate the validity of our dataset, we devise a simple retrieval model for dialogue sentence prediction tasks.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,MMGCN: Multimodal Fusion via Deep Graph Convolution Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation,"Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is a crucial component in affective dialogue systems, which helps the system understand users' emotions and generate empathetic responses. However, most works focus on modeling speaker and contextual information primarily on the textual modality or simply leveraging multimodal information through feature concatenation. In order to explore a more effective way of utilizing both multimodal and long-distance contextual information, we propose a new model based on multimodal fused graph convolutional network, MMGCN, in this work. MMGCN can not only make use of multimodal dependencies effectively, but also leverage speaker information to model inter-speaker and intra-speaker dependency. We evaluate our proposed model on two public benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, and the results prove the effectiveness of MMGCN, which outperforms other SOTA methods by a significant margin under the multimodal conversation setting.","{'sequence': ""Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is a crucial component in affective dialogue systems, which helps the system understand users' emotions and generate empathetic responses.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,DynaEval: Unifying Turn and Dialogue Level Evaluation,"A dialogue is essentially a multi-turn interaction among interlocutors. Effective evaluation metrics should reflect the dynamics of such interaction. Existing automatic metrics are focused very much on the turn-level quality, while ignoring such dynamics. To this end, we propose DynaEval 1 , a unified automatic evaluation framework which is not only capable of performing turn-level evaluation, but also holistically considers the quality of the entire dialogue. In DynaEval, the graph convolutional network (GCN) is adopted to model a dialogue in totality, where the graph nodes denote each individual utterance and the edges represent the dependency between pairs of utterances. A contrastive loss is then applied to distinguish well-formed dialogues from carefully constructed negative samples. Experiments show that DynaEval significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art dialogue coherence model, and correlates strongly with human judgements across multiple dialogue evaluation aspects at both turn and dialogue level.","{'sequence': 'A dialogue is essentially a multi-turn interaction among interlocutors.

Ethics and NLP,Exposing the limits of Zero-shot Cross-lingual Hate Speech Detection,"Reducing and counter-acting hate speech on Social Media is a significant concern.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Rewriter-Evaluator Architecture for Neural Machine Translation,"A few approaches have been developed to improve neural machine translation (NMT) models with multiple passes of decoding. However, their performance gains are limited because of lacking proper policies to terminate the multi-pass process. To address this issue, we introduce a novel architecture of Rewriter-Evaluator. Translating a source sentence involves multiple rewriting passes. In every pass, a rewriter generates a new translation to improve the past translation. Termination of this multi-pass process is determined by a score of translation quality estimated by an evaluator. We also propose prioritized gradient descent (PGD) to jointly and efficiently train the rewriter and the evaluator. Extensive experiments on three machine translation tasks show that our architecture notably improves the performances of NMT models and significantly outperforms prior methods.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Modeling Bilingual Conversational Characteristics for Neural Chat Translation,"Neural chat translation aims to translate bilingual conversational text, which has a broad application in international exchanges and cooperation. Despite the impressive performance of sentence-level and context-aware Neural Machine Translation (NMT), there still remain challenges to translate bilingual conversational text due to its inherent characteristics such as role preference, dialogue coherence, and translation consistency. In this paper, we aim to promote the translation quality of conversational text by modeling the above properties. Specifically, we design three latent variational modules to learn the distributions of bilingual conversational characteristics. Through sampling from these learned distributions, the latent variables, tailored for role preference, dialogue coherence, and translation consistency, are incorporated into the NMT model for better translation. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark dataset BConTrasT (English⇔German) and a self-collected bilingual dialogue corpus, named BMELD (English⇔Chinese). Extensive experiments show that our approach notably boosts the performance over strong baselines by a large margin and significantly surpasses some state-of-the-art context-aware NMT models in terms of BLEU and TER.

We evaluate our approach on the benchmark dataset BConTrasT (English⇔German) and a self-collected bilingual dialogue corpus, named BMELD (English⇔Chinese). Extensive experiments show that our approach notably boosts the performance over strong baselines by a large margin and significantly surpasses some state-of-the-art context-aware NMT models in terms of BLEU and TER. Additionally, we make the BMELD dataset publicly available for the research community. 1', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.15455138683319092, 0.08654807507991791, 0.07395950704813004, 0.050189658999443054, 0.04721097648143768, 0.04342345520853996, 0.04116757959127426, 0.041132040321826935, 0.04059220477938652, 0.03996513411402702, 0.03923941031098366, 0.03856731206178665, 0.03824072331190109, 0.035567425191402435, 0.03483474999666214, 0.033038850873708725, 0.03225759044289589, 0.03080686740577221, 0.02610701322555542, 0.02545151486992836, 0.02403268776834011, 0.013860268518328667, 0.009255632758140564]}",0.15455138683319092,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.15455138683319092
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Importance-based Neuron Allocation for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Multilingual neural machine translation with a single model has drawn much attention due to its capability to deal with multiple languages. However, the current multilingual translation paradigm often makes the model tend to preserve the general knowledge, but ignore the language-specific knowledge. Some previous works try to solve this problem by adding various kinds of language-specific modules to the model, but they suffer from the parameter explosion problem and require specialized manual design. To solve these problems, we propose to divide the model neurons into general and language-specific parts based on their importance across languages. The general part is responsible for preserving the general knowledge and participating in the translation of all the languages, while the language-specific part is responsible for preserving the languagespecific knowledge and participating in the translation of some specific languages. Experimental results on several language pairs, covering IWSLT and Europarl corpus datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method.","{'sequence': 'Multilingual neural machine translation with a single model has drawn much attention due to its capability to deal with multiple languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Transfer Learning for Sequence Generation: from Single-source to Multi-source,"Multi-source sequence generation (MSG) is an important kind of sequence generation tasks that takes multiple sources, including automatic post-editing, multi-source translation, multi-document summarization, etc. As MSG tasks suffer from the data scarcity problem and recent pretrained models have been proven to be effective for low-resource downstream tasks, transferring pretrained sequenceto-sequence models to MSG tasks is essential. Although directly finetuning pretrained models on MSG tasks and concatenating multiple sources into a single long sequence is regarded as a simple method to transfer pretrained models to MSG tasks, we conjecture that the direct finetuning method leads to catastrophic forgetting and solely relying on pretrained selfattention layers to capture cross-source information is not sufficient. Therefore, we propose a two-stage finetuning method to alleviate the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and introduce a novel MSG model with a fine encoder to learn better representations in MSG tasks. Experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on the WMT17 APE task and multi-source translation task using the WMT14 test set. When adapted to documentlevel translation, our framework outperforms strong baselines significantly. 1","{'sequence': 'Multi-source sequence generation (MSG) is an important kind of sequence generation tasks that takes multiple sources, including automatic post-editing, multi-source translation, multi-document summarization, etc. As MSG tasks suffer from the data scarcity problem and recent pretrained models have been proven to be effective for low-resource downstream tasks, transferring pretrained sequenceto-sequence models to MSG tasks is essential.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Closer Look at Few-Shot Crosslingual Transfer: The Choice of Shots Matters,"Few-shot crosslingual transfer has been shown to outperform its zero-shot counterpart with pretrained encoders like multilingual BERT. Despite its growing popularity, little to no attention has been paid to standardizing and analyzing the design of few-shot experiments. In this work, we highlight a fundamental risk posed by this shortcoming, illustrating that the model exhibits a high degree of sensitivity to the selection of few shots. We conduct a largescale experimental study on 40 sets of sampled few shots for six diverse NLP tasks across up to 40 languages. We provide an analysis of success and failure cases of few-shot transfer, which highlights the role of lexical features. Additionally, we show that a straightforward full model finetuning approach is quite effective for few-shot transfer, outperforming several state-of-the-art few-shot approaches. As a step towards standardizing few-shot crosslingual experimental designs, we make our sampled few shots publicly available. 1 * Equal contribution.","{'sequence': 'Few-shot crosslingual transfer has been shown to outperform its zero-shot counterpart with pretrained encoders like multilingual BERT.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Coreference Reasoning in Machine Reading Comprehension,"Coreference resolution is essential for natural language understanding and has been long studied in NLP. In recent years, as the format of Question Answering (QA) became a standard for machine reading comprehension (MRC), there have been data collection efforts, e.g., Dasigi et al. (2019), that attempt to evaluate the ability of MRC models to reason about coreference. However, as we show, coreference reasoning in MRC is a greater challenge than earlier thought; MRC datasets do not reflect the natural distribution and, consequently, the challenges of coreference reasoning. Specifically, success on these datasets does not reflect a model's proficiency in coreference reasoning. We propose a methodology for creating MRC datasets that better reflect the challenges of coreference reasoning and use it to create a sample evaluation set. The results on our dataset show that state-ofthe-art models still struggle with these phenomena.

The conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation, discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained representations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more computationally expensive than ours.

NLP Applications,SMedBERT: A Knowledge-Enhanced Pre-trained Language Model with Structured Semantics for Medical Text Mining,"Recently, the performance of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) has been significantly improved by injecting knowledge facts to enhance their abilities of language understanding. For medical domains, the background knowledge sources are especially useful, due to the massive medical terms and their complicated relations are difficult to understand in text. In this work, we introduce SMedBERT, a medical PLM trained on large-scale medical corpora, incorporating deep structured semantics knowledge from neighbours of linked-entity. In SMedBERT, the mention-neighbour hybrid attention is proposed to learn heterogeneousentity information, which infuses the semantic representations of entity types into the homogeneous neighbouring entity structure.

For medical domains, the background knowledge sources are especially useful, due to the massive medical terms and their complicated relations are difficult to understand in text. In this work, we introduce SMedBERT, a medical PLM trained on large-scale medical corpora, incorporating deep structured semantics knowledge from neighbours of linked-entity. In SMedBERT, the mention-neighbour hybrid attention is proposed to learn heterogeneousentity information, which infuses the semantic representations of entity types into the homogeneous neighbouring entity structure.

NLP Applications,What is Your Article Based On? Inferring Fine-grained Provenance,"When evaluating an article and the claims it makes, a critical reader must be able to assess where the information presented comes from, and whether the various claims are mutually consistent and support the conclusion. This motivates the study of claim provenance, which seeks to trace and explain the origins of claims. In this paper, we introduce new techniques to model and reason about the provenance of multiple interacting claims, including how to capture fine-grained information about the context. Our solution hinges on first identifying the sentences that potentially contain important external information. We then develop a query generator with our novel rank-aware cross attention mechanism, which aims at generating metadata for the source article, based on the context and signals collected from a search engine. This establishes relevant search queries, and it allows us to obtain source article candidates for each identified sentence and propose an ILP based algorithm to infer the best sources. We experiment with a newly created evaluation dataset 1 , Politi-Prov, based on fact-checking articles from www.politifa ct.com; our experimental results show that our solution leads to a significant improvement over baselines.","{'sequence': 'When evaluating an article and the claims it makes, a critical reader must be able to assess where the information presented comes from, and whether the various claims are mutually consistent and support the conclusion.

NLP Applications,Cross-modal Memory Networks for Radiology Report Generation,"Medical imaging plays a significant role in clinical practice of medical diagnosis, where the text reports of the images are essential in understanding them and facilitating later treatments. By generating the reports automatically, it is beneficial to help lighten the burden of radiologists and significantly promote clinical automation, which already attracts much attention in applying artificial intelligence to medical domain. Previous studies mainly follow the encoder-decoder paradigm and focus on the aspect of text generation, with few studies considering the importance of cross-modal mappings and explicitly exploit such mappings to facilitate radiology report generation.

NLP Applications,Multi-perspective Coherent Reasoning for Helpfulness Prediction of Multimodal Reviews,"As more and more product reviews are posted in both text and images, Multimodal Review Analysis (MRA) becomes an attractive research topic. Among the existing review analysis tasks, helpfulness prediction on review text has become predominant due to its importance for e-commerce platforms and online shops, i.e. helping customers quickly acquire useful product information. This paper proposes a new task Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) aiming to analyze the review helpfulness from text and visual modalities. Meanwhile, a novel Multi-perspective Coherent Reasoning method (MCR) is proposed to solve the MRHP task, which conducts joint reasoning over texts and images from both the product and the review, and aggregates the signals to predict the review helpfulness. Concretely, we first propose a productreview coherent reasoning module to measure the intra-and inter-modal coherence between the target product and the review. In addition, we also devise an intra-review coherent reasoning module to identify the coherence between the text content and images of the review, which is a piece of strong evidence for review helpfulness prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCR, we present two newly collected multimodal review datasets as benchmark evaluation resources for the MRHP task. Experimental results show that our MCR method can lead to a performance increase of up to 8.5% as compared to the best performing text-only model.

NLP Applications,Instantaneous Grammatical Error Correction with Shallow Aggressive Decoding,"In this paper, we propose Shallow Aggressive Decoding (SAD) to improve the online inference efficiency of the Transformer for instantaneous Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). SAD optimizes the online inference efficiency for GEC by two innovations: 1) it aggressively decodes as many tokens as possible in parallel instead of always decoding only one token in each step to improve computational parallelism; 2) it uses a shallow decoder instead of the conventional Transformer architecture with balanced encoder-decoder depth to reduce the computational cost during inference. Experiments in both English and Chinese GEC benchmarks show that aggressive decoding could yield the same predictions as greedy decoding but with a significant speedup for online inference. Its combination with the shallow decoder could offer an even higher online inference speedup over the powerful Transformer baseline without quality loss. Not only does our approach allow a single model to achieve the state-of-the-art results in English GEC benchmarks: 66.4 F 0.5 in the CoNLL-14 and 72.9 F 0.5 in the BEA-19 test set with an almost 10× online inference speedup over the Transformer-big model, but also it is easily adapted to other languages.

NLP Applications,PHMOSpell: Phonological and Morphological Knowledge Guided Chinese Spelling Check,"Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) is a challenging task due to the complex characteristics of Chinese characters. Statistics reveal that most Chinese spelling errors belong to phonological or visual errors. However, previous methods rarely utilize phonological and morphological knowledge of Chinese characters or heavily rely on external resources to model their similarities. To address the above issues, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable model called PHMOSpell, which promotes the performance of CSC with multi-modal information. Specifically, we derive pinyin and glyph representations for Chinese characters from audio and visual modalities respectively, which are integrated into a pre-trained language model by a well-designed adaptive gating mechanism. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation tests.

Although neural models for table-to-text have achieved remarkable progress, some problems are still overlooked.

To solve this issue, we first build an entity graph from the input tables and introduce a reasoning module to perform reasoning on the graph. Moreover, there are different relations (e.g., the numeric size relation and the importance relation) between records in different dimensions. And these relations may contribute to the data-to-text generation. However, it is hard for a vanilla encoder to capture these. Consequently, we propose to utilize two auxiliary tasks, Number Ranking (NR) and Importance Ranking (IR), to supervise the encoder to capture the different relations.

Generation,POS-Constrained Parallel Decoding for Non-autoregressive Generation,"The multimodality problem has become a major challenge of existing non-autoregressive generation (NAG) systems. A common solution often resorts to sequence-level knowledge distillation by rebuilding the training dataset through autoregressive generation (hereinafter known as ""teacher AG"").

However, in this work, we experimentally reveal that this assumption does not always hold for the text generation tasks like text summarization and story ending generation. To provide a feasible solution to the multimodality problem of NAG, we propose incorporating linguistic structure (Part-of-Speech sequence in particular) into NAG inference instead of relying on teacher AG. More specifically, the proposed POS-constrained Parallel Decoding (POSPD) method aims at providing a specific POS sequence to constrain the NAG model during decoding.

Generation,Bridging Subword Gaps in Pretrain-Finetune Paradigm for Natural Language Generation,"A well-known limitation in pretrain-finetune paradigm lies in its inflexibility caused by the one-size-fits-all vocabulary. This potentially weakens the effect when applying pretrained models into natural language generation (NLG) tasks, especially for the subword distributions between upstream and downstream tasks with significant discrepancy. Towards approaching this problem, we extend the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline with an extra embedding transfer step. Specifically, a plug-and-play embedding generator is introduced to produce the representation of any input token, according to pre-trained embeddings of its morphologically similar ones. Thus, embeddings of mismatch tokens in downstream tasks can also be efficiently initialized. We conduct experiments on a variety of NLG tasks under the pretrain-finetune fashion.

Summarization,Long-Span Summarization via Local Attention and Content Selection,"Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including document summarization. Typically these systems are trained by fine-tuning a large pretrained model to the target task. One issue with these transformer-based models is that they do not scale well in terms of memory and compute requirements as the input length grows. Thus, for long document summarization, it can be challenging to train or fine-tune these models. In this work, we exploit large pre-trained transformer-based models and address long-span dependencies in abstractive summarization using two methods: local self-attention; and explicit content selection. These approaches are compared on a range of network configurations. Experiments are carried out on standard long-span summarization tasks, including Spotify Podcast, arXiv, and PubMed datasets.

Typically these systems are trained by fine-tuning a large pretrained model to the target task. One issue with these transformer-based models is that they do not scale well in terms of memory and compute requirements as the input length grows. Thus, for long document summarization, it can be challenging to train or fine-tune these models. In this work, we exploit large pre-trained transformer-based models and address long-span dependencies in abstractive summarization using two methods: local self-attention; and explicit content selection. These approaches are compared on a range of network configurations. Experiments are carried out on standard long-span summarization tasks, including Spotify Podcast, arXiv, and PubMed datasets. We demonstrate that by combining these methods, we can achieve state-of-the-art results on all three tasks in the ROUGE scores.

Summarization,RepSum: Unsupervised Dialogue Summarization based on Replacement Strategy,"In the field of dialogue summarization, due to the lack of training data, it is often difficult for supervised summary generation methods to learn vital information from dialogue context. Several works on unsupervised summarization for document by leveraging semantic information solely or auto-encoder strategy (i.e., sentence compression), they however cannot be adapted to the dialogue scene due to the limited words in utterances and huge gap between the dialogue and its summary. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised strategy to address this challenge, which roots from the hypothetical foundation that a superior summary approximates a replacement of the original dialogue, and they are roughly equivalent for auxiliary (self-supervised) tasks, e.g., dialogue generation. The proposed strategy Rep-Sum is applied to generate both extractive and abstractive summary with the guidance of the followed n th utterance generation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared with other unsupervised methods.","{'sequence': 'In the field of dialogue summarization, due to the lack of training data, it is often difficult for supervised summary generation methods to learn vital information from dialogue context.

Summarization,Capturing Relations between Scientific Papers: An Abstractive Model for Related Work Section Generation,"Given a set of related publications, related work section generation aims to provide researchers with an overview of the specific research area by summarizing these works and introducing them in a logical order.

Hence, in this paper, we propose a Relationaware Related work Generator (RRG), which generates an abstractive related work section from multiple scientific papers in the same research area. Concretely, we propose a relationaware multi-document encoder that relates one document to another according to their content dependency in a relation graph. The relation graph and the document representation interact and are refined iteratively, complementing each other in the training process.

When evaluated on the BBC extreme summarization task, two state-of-the-art models augmented with Focus Attention generate summaries that are closer to the target and more faithful to their input documents, outperforming their vanilla counterparts on ROUGE and multiple faithfulness measures.

Experiments show that S2G can achieve a better performance against strong baselines on problems that require domain knowledge. 1', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.16617515683174133, 0.13100282847881317, 0.058868613094091415, 0.058070119470357895, 0.05675315856933594, 0.05071277171373367, 0.04770103096961975, 0.04423152655363083, 0.03741345927119255, 0.03441236540675163, 0.03436863049864769, 0.03352326527237892, 0.031763412058353424, 0.028970709070563316, 0.026296738535165787, 0.02567620389163494, 0.023083359003067017, 0.023034950718283653, 0.022395063191652298, 0.01855011098086834, 0.018332645297050476, 0.01622343249619007, 0.012440466322004795]}",0.16617515683174133,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.058868613094091415
Question Answering,Robustifying Multi-hop QA through Pseudo-Evidentiality Training,"This paper studies the bias problem of multihop question answering models, of answering correctly without correct reasoning. One way to robustify these models is by supervising to not only answer right, but also with right reasoning chains. An existing direction is to annotate reasoning chains to train models, requiring expensive additional annotations. In contrast, we propose a new approach to learn evidentiality, deciding whether the answer prediction is supported by correct evidences, without such annotations. Instead, we compare counterfactual changes in answer confidence with and without evidence sentences, to generate ""pseudo-evidentiality"" annotations. We validate our proposed model on an original set and challenge set in HotpotQA, showing that our method is accurate and robust in multi-hop reasoning.","{'sequence': 'This paper studies the bias problem of multihop question answering models, of answering correctly without correct reasoning.

Question Answering,Efficient Passage Retrieval with Hashing for Open-domain Question Answering,"Most state-of-the-art open-domain question answering systems use a neural retrieval model to encode passages into continuous vectors and extract them from a knowledge source. However, such retrieval models often require large memory to run because of the massive size of their passage index.

BPR is trained with a multi-task objective over two tasks: efficient candidate generation based on binary codes and accurate reranking based on continuous vectors.

Question Answering,Learn to Resolve Conversational Dependency: A Consistency Training Framework for Conversational Question Answering,"One of the main challenges in conversational question answering (CQA) is to resolve the conversational dependency, such as anaphora and ellipsis.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Attend What You Need: Motion-Appearance Synergistic Networks for Video Question Answering,"Video Question Answering is a task which requires an AI agent to answer questions grounded in video. This task entails three key challenges: (1) understand the intention of various questions, (2) capturing various elements of the input video (e.g., object, action, causality), and (3) cross-modal grounding between language and vision information. We propose Motion-Appearance Synergistic Networks (MASN), which embed two crossmodal features grounded on motion and appearance information and selectively utilize them depending on the question's intentions. MASN consists of a motion module, an appearance module, and a motion-appearance fusion module. The motion module computes the action-oriented cross-modal joint representations, while the appearance module focuses on the appearance aspect of the input video. Finally, the motion-appearance fusion module takes each output of the motion module and the appearance module as input, and performs question-guided fusion. As a result, MASN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the TGIF-QA and MSVD-QA datasets. We also conduct qualitative analysis by visualizing the inference results of MASN. The code is available at https://github.com/ ahjeongseo/MASN-pytorch.","{'sequence': ""Video Question Answering is a task which requires an AI agent to answer questions grounded in video.

Information Extraction,BERTifying the Hidden Markov Model for Multi-Source Weakly Supervised Named Entity Recognition,"We study the problem of learning a named entity recognition (NER) tagger using noisy labels from multiple weak supervision sources. Though cheap to obtain, the labels from weak supervision sources are often incomplete, inaccurate, and contradictory, making it difficult to learn an accurate NER model. To address this challenge, we propose a conditional hidden Markov model (CHMM), which can effectively infer true labels from multi-source noisy labels in an unsupervised way. CHMM enhances the classic hidden Markov model with the contextual representation power of pretrained language models. Specifically, CHMM learns token-wise transition and emission probabilities from the BERT embeddings of the input tokens to infer the latent true labels from noisy observations. We further refine CHMM with an alternate-training approach (CHMM-ALT). It fine-tunes a BERT-NER model with the labels inferred by CHMM, and this BERT-NER's output is regarded as an additional weak source to train the CHMM in return. Experiments on four NER benchmarks from various domains show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised NER models by wide margins.","{'sequence': ""We study the problem of learning a named entity recognition (NER) tagger using noisy labels from multiple weak supervision sources.

Information Extraction,SENT: Sentence-level Distant Relation Extraction via Negative Training,"Distant supervision for relation extraction provides uniform bag labels for each sentence inside the bag, while accurate sentence labels are important for downstream applications that need the exact relation type. Directly using bag labels for sentence-level training will introduce much noise, thus severely degrading performance. In this work, we propose the use of negative training (NT), in which a model is trained using complementary labels regarding that ""the instance does not belong to these complementary labels"". Since the probability of selecting a true label as a complementary label is low, NT provides less noisy information. Furthermore, the model trained with NT is able to separate the noisy data from the training data. Based on NT, we propose a sentence-level framework, SENT, for distant relation extraction. SENT not only filters the noisy data to construct a cleaner dataset, but also performs a relabeling process to transform the noisy data into useful training data, thus further benefiting the model's performance. Experimental results show the significant improvement of the proposed method over previous methods on sentence-level evaluation and de-noise effect.","{'sequence': 'Distant supervision for relation extraction provides uniform bag labels for each sentence inside the bag, while accurate sentence labels are important for downstream applications that need the exact relation type.

Information Extraction,PRGC: Potential Relation and Global Correspondence Based Joint Relational Triple Extraction,"Joint extraction of entities and relations from unstructured texts is a crucial task in information extraction. Recent methods achieve considerable performance but still suffer from some inherent limitations, such as redundancy of relation prediction, poor generalization of span-based extraction and inefficiency. In this paper, we decompose this task into three subtasks, Relation Judgement, Entity Extraction and Subject-object Alignment from a novel perspective and then propose a joint relational triple extraction framework based on Potential Relation and Global Correspondence (PRGC). Specifically, we design a component to predict potential relations, which constrains the following entity extraction to the predicted relation subset rather than all relations; then a relation-specific sequence tagging component is applied to handle the overlapping problem between subjects and objects; finally, a global correspondence component is designed to align the subject and object into a triple with low-complexity.

Information Extraction,Joint Biomedical Entity and Relation Extraction with Knowledge-Enhanced Collective Inference,"Compared to the general news domain, information extraction (IE) from biomedical text requires much broader domain knowledge. However, many previous IE methods do not utilize any external knowledge during inference. Due to the exponential growth of biomedical publications, models that do not go beyond their fixed set of parameters will likely fall behind. Inspired by how humans look up relevant information to comprehend a scientific text, we present a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge for joint entity and relation extraction named KECI (Knowledge-Enhanced Collective Inference). Given an input text, KECI first constructs an initial span graph representing its initial understanding of the text. It then uses an entity linker to form a knowledge graph containing relevant background knowledge for the the entity mentions in the text. To make the final predictions, KECI fuses the initial span graph and the knowledge graph into a more refined graph using an attention mechanism. KECI takes a collective approach to link mention spans to entities by integrating global relational information into local representations using graph convolutional networks. Our experimental results show that the framework is highly effective, achieving new state-of-theart results in two different benchmark datasets: BioRelEx (binding interaction detection) and ADE (adverse drug event extraction). For example, KECI achieves absolute improvements of 4.59% and 4.91% in F1 scores over the stateof-the-art on the BioRelEx entity and relation extraction tasks 1 .","{'sequence': 'Compared to the general news domain, information extraction (IE) from biomedical text requires much broader domain knowledge.

For example, KECI achieves absolute improvements of 4.59% and 4.91% in F1 scores over the stateof-the-art on the BioRelEx entity and relation extraction tasks 1 .', 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Question Answering', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.43249982595443726, 0.04869415983557701, 0.04142909124493599, 0.036371052265167236, 0.03567473962903023, 0.034571316093206406, 0.031866759061813354, 0.028004586696624756, 0.027786457911133766, 0.02699187956750393, 0.025073420256376266, 0.02450714446604252, 0.02440759539604187, 0.024216076359152794, 0.02368210256099701, 0.022333813831210136, 0.02092205546796322, 0.018910707905888557, 0.01843651756644249, 0.016146544367074966, 0.015284311026334763, 0.01472387369722128, 0.007465891074389219]}",0.43249982595443726,Information Extraction,0.43249982595443726
Information Extraction,Entity Concept-enhanced Few-shot Relation Extraction,"Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) is of great importance in long-tail distribution problem, especially in special domain with low-resource data. Most existing FSRE algorithms fail to accurately classify the relations merely based on the information of the sentences together with the recognized entity pairs, due to limited samples and lack of knowledge. To address this problem, in this paper, we proposed a novel entity CONCEPTenhanced FEw-shot Relation Extraction scheme (ConceptFERE), which introduces the inherent concepts of entities to provide clues for relation prediction and boost the relations classification performance. Firstly, a conceptsentence attention module is developed to select the most appropriate concept from multiple concepts of each entity by calculating the semantic similarity between sentences and concepts. Secondly, a self-attention based fusion module is presented to bridge the gap of concept embedding and sentence embedding from different semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on the FSRE benchmark dataset FewRel have demonstrated the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed ConceptFERE scheme as compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

Information Extraction,Fine-grained Information Extraction from Biomedical Literature based on Knowledge-enriched Abstract Meaning Representation,"Biomedical Information Extraction from scientific literature presents two unique and nontrivial challenges. First, compared with general natural language texts, sentences from scientific papers usually possess wider contexts between knowledge elements. Moreover, comprehending the fine-grained scientific entities and events urgently requires domain-specific background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical Information Extraction (IE) model to tackle these two challenges and extract scientific entities and events from English research papers. We perform Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to compress the wide context to uncover a clear semantic structure for each complex sentence. Besides, we construct the sentence-level knowledge graph from an external knowledge base and use it to enrich the AMR graph to improve the model's understanding of complex scientific concepts. We use an edge-conditioned graph attention network to encode the knowledgeenriched AMR graph for biomedical IE tasks. Experiments on the GENIA 2011 dataset show that the AMR and external knowledge have contributed 1.8% and 3.0% absolute F-score gains respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of our approach on real-world problems that involve topic-specific fine-grained knowledge elements, we have also created a new ontology and annotated corpus for entity and event extraction for the COVID-19 scientific literature, which can serve as a new benchmark for the biomedical IE community. 1","{'sequence': ""Biomedical Information Extraction from scientific literature presents two unique and nontrivial challenges.

Information Extraction,Unleash GPT-2 Power for Event Detection,"Event Detection (ED) aims to recognize mentions of events (i.e., event triggers) and their types in text. Recently, several ED datasets in various domains have been proposed. However, the major limitation of these resources is the lack of enough training data for individual event types which hinders the efficient training of data-hungry deep learning models. To overcome this issue, we propose to exploit the powerful pre-trained language model GPT-2 to generate training samples for ED. To prevent the noises inevitable in automatically generated data from hampering training process, we propose to exploit a teacher-student architecture in which the teacher is supposed to learn anchor knowledge from the original data. The student is then trained on combination of the original and GPT-generated data while being led by the anchor knowledge from the teacher. Optimal transport is introduced to facilitate the anchor knowledge-based guidance between the two networks.

Information Extraction,Improving Model Generalization: A Chinese Named Entity Recognition Case Study,"Generalization is an important ability that helps to ensure that a machine learning model can perform well on unseen data. In this paper, we study the effect of data bias on model generalization, using Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a case study. Specifically, we analyzed five benchmarking datasets for Chinese NER, and observed the following two types of data bias that may compromise model generalization ability. Firstly, the test sets of all the five datasets contain a significant proportion of entities that have been seen in the training sets. These test data are therefore not suitable for evaluating how well a model can handle unseen data. Secondly, all datasets are dominated by a few fat-head entities, i.e., entities appearing with particularly high frequency. As a result, a model might be able to produce high prediction accuracy simply by keyword memorization. To address these data biases, we first refine each test set by excluding seen entities from it, so as to better evaluate a model's generalization ability. Then, we propose a simple yet effective entity rebalancing method to make entities within the same category distributed equally, encouraging a model to leverage both name and context knowledge in the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed entity resampling method significantly improves a model's ability in detecting unseen entities, especially for company, organization and position categories.","{'sequence': ""Generalization is an important ability that helps to ensure that a machine learning model can perform well on unseen data.

Information Extraction,Document-level Event Extraction via Parallel Prediction Networks,"Document-level event extraction (DEE) is indispensable when events are described throughout a document. We argue that sentence-level extractors are ill-suited to the DEE task where event arguments always scatter across sentences and multiple events may co-exist in a document. It is a challenging task because it requires a holistic understanding of the document and an aggregated ability to assemble arguments across multiple sentences. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model, which can extract structured events from a document in a parallel manner. Specifically, we first introduce a document-level encoder to obtain the document-aware representations. Then, a multi-granularity non-autoregressive decoder is used to generate events in parallel. Finally, to train the entire model, a matching loss function is proposed, which can bootstrap a global optimization. The empirical results on the widely used DEE dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms current stateof-the-art methods in the challenging DEE task.","{'sequence': 'Document-level event extraction (DEE) is indispensable when events are described throughout a document.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Dual Graph Convolutional Networks for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a finegrained sentiment classification task. Recently, graph neural networks over dependency trees have been explored to explicitly model connections between aspects and opinion words. However, the improvement is limited due to the inaccuracy of the dependency parsing results and the informal expressions and complexity of online reviews. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a dual graph convolutional networks (Du-alGCN) model that considers the complementarity of syntax structures and semantic correlations simultaneously. Particularly, to alleviate dependency parsing errors, we design a SynGCN module with rich syntactic knowledge. To capture semantic correlations, we design a SemGCN module with self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose orthogonal and differential regularizers to capture semantic correlations between words precisely by constraining attention scores in the SemGCN module. The orthogonal regularizer encourages the SemGCN to learn semantically correlated words with less overlap for each word.
