"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Overestimation of Syntactic Representation in Neural Language Models,"With the advent of powerful neural language models over the last few years, research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they represent that make them so successful. Several testing methodologies have been developed to probe models' syntactic representations. One popular method for determining a model's ability to induce syntactic structure trains a model on strings generated according to a template then tests the model's ability to distinguish such strings from superficially similar ones with different syntax. We illustrate a fundamental problem with this approach by reproducing positive results from a recent paper with two non-syntactic baseline language models: an n-gram model and an LSTM model trained on scrambled inputs.","{'sequence': ""With the advent of powerful neural language models over the last few years, research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they represent that make them so successful.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Inflecting When There's No Majority: Limitations of Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks as Cognitive Models for German Plurals,"Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do? Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form /-(e)d/ to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995) : that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class -and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like /-s/ can still be productively generalized. To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization.","{'sequence': ""Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do?

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",A Systematic Assessment of Syntactic Generalization in Neural Language Models,"While state-of-the-art neural network models continue to achieve lower perplexity scores on language modeling benchmarks, it remains unknown whether optimizing for broad-coverage predictive performance leads to human-like syntactic knowledge. Furthermore, existing work has not provided a clear picture about the model properties required to produce proper syntactic generalizations. We present a systematic evaluation of the syntactic knowledge of neural language models, testing 20 combinations of model types and data sizes on a set of 34 English-language syntactic test suites. We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M-40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Latent Categorization of Interview Prompts,"Despite the pervasiveness of clinical depression in modern society, professional help remains highly stigmatized, inaccessible, and expensive. Accurately diagnosing depression is difficult-requiring time-intensive interviews, assessments, and analysis. Hence, automated methods that can assess linguistic patterns in these interviews could help psychiatric professionals make faster, more informed decisions about diagnosis. We propose JLPC, a method that analyzes interview transcripts to identify depression while jointly categorizing interview prompts into latent categories. This latent categorization allows the model to identify high-level conversational contexts that influence patterns of language in depressed individuals. We show that the proposed model not only outperforms competitive baselines, but that its latent prompt categories provide psycholinguistic insights about depression.","{'sequence': 'Despite the pervasiveness of clinical depression in modern society, professional help remains highly stigmatized, inaccessible, and expensive.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Recollection versus Imagination: Exploring Human Memory and Cognition via Neural Language Models,"We investigate the use of NLP as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events. To facilitate this, we collect and release HIPPOCORPUS, a dataset of 7,000 stories about imagined and recalled events. We introduce a measure of narrative flow and use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled events. Additionally, we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. Our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow, compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. In addition, while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory, imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. Finally, our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories (e.g., stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; Bartlett, 1932) .

In this paper, we present the first computational study of parody. We introduce a new publicly available data set of tweets from real politicians and their corresponding parody accounts. We run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets with an emphasis on robustness by testing on tweets from accounts unseen in training, across different genders and across countries. Our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%. Finally, we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis.

We build a new large-scale dataset, from multiple data sources, connecting state bills and legislator information, geographical information about their districts, and donations and donors' information. We suggest a novel task, predicting the legislative body's vote breakdown for a given bill, according to different criteria of interest, such as gender, rural-urban and ideological splits. Finally, we suggest a shared relational embedding model, representing the interactions between the text of the bill and the legislative context in which it is presented.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Integrating Semantic and Structural Information with Graph Convolutional Network for Controversy Detection,"Identifying controversial posts on social media is a fundamental task for mining public sentiment, assessing the influence of events, and alleviating the polarized views. However, existing methods fail to 1) effectively incorporate the semantic information from contentrelated posts; 2) preserve the structural information for reply relationship modeling; 3) properly handle posts from topics dissimilar to those in the training set. To overcome the first two limitations, we propose Topic-Post-Comment Graph Convolutional Network (TPC-GCN), which integrates the information from the graph structure and content of topics, posts, and comments for post-level controversy detection. As to the third limitation, we extend our model to Disentangled TPC-GCN (DTPC-GCN), to disentangle topic-related and topic-unrelated features and then fuse dynamically. Extensive experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate that our models outperform existing methods. Analysis of the results and cases proves that our models can integrate both semantic and structural information with significant generalizability.","{'sequence': 'Identifying controversial posts on social media is a fundamental task for mining public sentiment, assessing the influence of events, and alleviating the polarized views.

Prior studies have shown that some individuals can predict the outcome of future events with consistently better accuracy. This leads to a natural question: what makes some forecasters better than others?

Datasets from two different forecasting domains are explored: (1) geopolitical forecasts from Good Judgment Open, an online prediction forum and (2) a corpus of company earnings forecasts made by financial analysts. We present a number of linguistic metrics which are computed over text associated with people's predictions about the future including: uncertainty, readability, and emotion. By studying linguistic factors associated with predictions, we are able to shed some light on the approach taken by skilled forecasters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict forecasting skill using a model that is based solely on language.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,"Stock Embeddings Acquired from News Articles and Price History, and an Application to Portfolio Optimization","Previous works that integrated news articles to better process stock prices used a variety of neural networks to predict price movements. The textual and price information were both encoded in the neural network, and it is therefore difficult to apply this approach in situations other than the original framework of the notoriously hard problem of price prediction. In contrast, this paper presents a method to encode the influence of news articles through a vector representation of stocks called a stock embedding. The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction. As one example application, we show the results of portfolio optimization using Reuters & Bloomberg headlines, producing a capital gain 2.8 times larger than that obtained with a baseline method using only stock price data. This suggests that the proposed stock embedding can leverage textual financial semantics to solve financial prediction problems.","{'sequence': 'Previous works that integrated news articles to better process stock prices used a variety of neural networks to predict price movements.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Predicting the Topical Stance and Political Leaning of Media using Tweets,"Discovering the stances of media outlets and influential people on current, debatable topics is important for social statisticians and policy makers.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,DTCA: Decision Tree-based Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Claim Verification,"Recently, many methods discover effective evidence from reliable sources by appropriate neural networks for explainable claim verification, which has been widely recognized. However, in these methods, the discovery process of evidence is nontransparent and unexplained. Simultaneously, the discovered evidence only roughly aims at the interpretability of the whole sequence of claims but insufficient to focus on the false parts of claims. In this paper, we propose a Decision Tree-based Co-Attention model (DTCA) to discover evidence for explainable claim verification. Specifically, we first construct Decision Tree-based Evidence model (DTE) to select comments with high credibility as evidence in a transparent and interpretable way. Then we design Co-attention Self-attention networks (CaSa) to make the selected evidence interact with claims, which is for 1) training DTE to determine the optimal decision thresholds and obtain more powerful evidence; and 2) utilizing the evidence to find the false parts in the claim. Experiments on two public datasets, RumourEval and PHEME, demonstrate that DTCA not only provides explanations for the results of claim verification but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance, boosting the F1-score by 3.11%, 2.41%, respectively. 24 Compute loss L(Θ) using Eq.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Improving Multimodal Named Entity Recognition via Entity Span Detection with Unified Multimodal Transformer,"In this paper, we study Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) for social media posts. Existing approaches for MNER mainly suffer from two drawbacks: (1) despite generating word-aware visual representations, their word representations are insensitive to the visual context; (2) most of them ignore the bias brought by the visual context. To tackle the first issue, we propose a multimodal interaction module to obtain both image-aware word representations and word-aware visual representations. To alleviate the visual bias, we further propose to leverage purely text-based entity span detection as an auxiliary module, and design a Unified Multimodal Transformer to guide the final predictions with the entity span predictions. Experiments show that our unified approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we study Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) for social media posts.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,What Was Written vs. Who Read It: News Media Profiling Using Text Analysis and Social Media Context,"Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction. The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online, has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Alternatively, we can profile entire news outlets and look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This approach makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself on Twitter) vs. (ii) who read it (i.e., analyzing the readers of the target medium on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube). We further study (iii)  what was written about the target medium on Wikipedia.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Balancing Objectives in Counseling Conversations: Advancing Forwards or Looking Backwards,"Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction. Such choices are particularly salient in the consequential domain of crisis counseling, where a difficulty for counselors is balancing between two key objectives: advancing the conversation towards a resolution, and empathetically addressing the crisis situation. In this work, we develop an unsupervised methodology to quantify how counselors manage this balance. Our main intuition is that if an utterance can only receive a narrow range of appropriate replies, then its likely aim is to advance the conversation forwards, towards a target within that range. Likewise, an utterance that can only appropriately follow a narrow range of possible utterances is likely aimed backwards at addressing a specific situation within that range. By applying this intuition, we can map each utterance to a continuous orientation axis that captures the degree to which it is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards. This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its effectiveness.","{'sequence': ""Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Dynamic Online Conversation Recommendation,"Trending topics in social media content evolve over time, and it is therefore crucial to understand social media users and their interpersonal communications in a dynamic manner. In this research we study dynamic online conversation recommendation, to help users engage in conversations that satisfy their evolving interests. Different from works in conversation recommendation which assume static user interests, our model captures the temporal aspects of user interests. Moreover, our model can cater for cold start problem where conversations are new and unseen in training. We propose a neural architecture to analyze changes of user interactions and interests over time, whose result is used to predict which discussions the users are likely to enter. We conduct experiments on large-scale collections of Reddit conversations. Results on three subreddits show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models based on static assumption of user interests. We further evaluate performance in cold start, and observe consistently better performance by our model when considering various degrees of sparsity of user's chatting history and conversation contexts. Lastly, our analysis also confirms the change of user interests. This further justify the advantage and efficacy of our model.","{'sequence': ""Trending topics in social media content evolve over time, and it is therefore crucial to understand social media users and their interpersonal communications in a dynamic manner.

Yet, methods and applications for this problem are scattered across different communities and evaluation practices are inconsistent. This review is the first to gather and categorize these examples and provide a guide to dataprocessing and evaluation decisions.

Though the model does not analyze their votes or political affiliations, the separates lawmakers by party, learns interpretable politicized topics, and infers ideal points close to the classical vote-based ideal points. One benefit of analyzing texts, as opposed to votes, is that the can estimate ideal points of anyone who authors political texts, including non-voting actors.

We demonstrate that models with message-level attention outperform those with word-level attention, and ultimately yield stateof-the-art accuracies for all five traits by using both word and message attention in combination with past approaches (an average increase in Pearson r of 2.5%). In addition, examination of the high-signal posts identified by our model provides insight into the relationship between language and personality, helping to inform future work.","{'sequence': ""Not all documents are equally important.

In addition, examination of the high-signal posts identified by our model provides insight into the relationship between language and personality, helping to inform future work."", 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theme', 'Summarization', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Generation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08902700990438461, 0.06233644112944603, 0.05480972304940224, 0.053174588829278946, 0.05238132178783417, 0.05068989470601082, 0.049376629292964935, 0.04870510473847389, 0.04681558907032013, 0.04221120476722717, 0.03991837427020073, 0.0382998064160347, 0.03609263524413109, 0.035790883004665375, 0.033794719725847244, 0.033402904868125916, 0.032833199948072433, 0.0308717992156744, 0.030619345605373383, 0.02938958629965782, 0.02232845313847065, 0.02108047716319561, 0.020458368584513664, 0.01775972545146942, 0.017314467579126358, 0.010517778806388378]}",0.08902700990438461,Information Extraction,0.04681558907032013
Computational Social Science and Social Media,When do Word Embeddings Accurately Reflect Surveys on our Beliefs About People?,"Social biases are encoded in word embeddings. This presents a unique opportunity to study society historically and at scale, and a unique danger when embeddings are used in downstream applications. Here, we investigate the extent to which publicly-available word embeddings accurately reflect beliefs about certain kinds of people as measured via traditional survey methods. We find that biases found in word embeddings do, on average, closely mirror survey data across seventeen dimensions of social meaning. However, we also find that biases in embeddings are much more reflective of survey data for some dimensions of meaning (e.g. gender) than others (e.g. race), and that we can be highly confident that embedding-based measures reflect survey data only for the most salient biases.","{'sequence': 'Social biases are encoded in word embeddings.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling,"As an essential task in task-oriented dialog systems, slot filling requires extensive training data in a certain domain. However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-theart approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Data Manipulation: Towards Effective Instance Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation via Learning to Augment and Reweight,"Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm. As such, a reliable training corpus is the crux of building a robust and well-behaved dialogue model. However, due to the open-ended nature of human conversations, the quality of user-generated training data varies greatly, and effective training samples are typically insufficient while noisy samples frequently appear. This impedes the learning of those data-driven neural dialogue models. Therefore, effective dialogue learning requires not only more reliable learning samples, but also fewer noisy samples. In this paper, we propose a data manipulation framework to proactively reshape the data distribution towards reliable samples by augmenting and highlighting effective learning samples as well as reducing the effect of inefficient samples simultaneously. In particular, the data manipulation model selectively augments the training samples and assigns an importance weight to each instance to reform the training data. Note that, the proposed data manipulation framework is fully data-driven and learnable. It not only manipulates training samples to optimize the dialogue generation model, but also learns to increase its manipulation skills through gradient descent with validation samples. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the dialogue generation performance with respect to various automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments.","{'sequence': 'Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,CDL: Curriculum Dual Learning for Emotion-Controllable Response Generation,"Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging. Existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization terms to standard cross-entropy loss and thus influence the training process. However, due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency, the common problem of response generation tasks, safe response, is intensified. Besides, query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and response are simply ignored in previous models, which would further hurt the coherence. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework named Curriculum Dual Learning (CDL) which extends the emotion-controllable response generation to a dual task to generate emotional responses and emotional queries alternatively. CDL utilizes two rewards focusing on emotion and content to improve the duality. Additionally, it applies curriculum learning to gradually generate high-quality responses based on the difficulties of expressing various emotions. Experimental results show that CDL significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of coherence, diversity, and relation to emotion factors.","{'sequence': 'Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot","This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world. XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast humanmachine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of largescale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.","{'sequence': 'This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dialogue State Tracking with Explicit Slot Connection Modeling,"Recent proposed approaches have made promising progress in dialogue state tracking (DST). However, in multi-domain scenarios, ellipsis and reference are frequently adopted by users to express values that have been mentioned by slots from other domains. To handle these phenomena, we propose a Dialogue State Tracking with Slot Connections (DST-SC) model to explicitly consider slot correlations across different domains.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,MuTual: A Dataset for Multi-Turn Dialogue Reasoning,"Non-task oriented dialogue systems have achieved great success in recent years due to largely accessible conversation data and the development of deep learning techniques. Given a context, current systems are able to yield a relevant and fluent response, but sometimes make logical mistakes because of weak reasoning capabilities. To facilitate the conversation reasoning research, we introduce Mu-Tual, a novel dataset for Multi-Turn dialogue Reasoning, consisting of 8,860 manually annotated dialogues based on Chinese student English listening comprehension exams. Compared to previous benchmarks for non-task oriented dialogue systems, MuTual is much more challenging since it requires a model that can handle various reasoning problems. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art methods only reach 71%, which is far behind the human performance of 94%, indicating that there is ample room for improving reasoning ability.

To obtain an acceptable success in real-life online services with only a handful of training examples, both fast adaptability and reliable performance are highly desirable for dialog systems.

We evaluate our methods on a new extended-bAbI dataset and a transformed MultiWOZ dataset for lowresource goal-oriented dialog learning.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Semi-Supervised Dialogue Policy Learning via Stochastic Reward Estimation,"Dialogue policy optimization often obtains feedback until task completion in taskoriented dialogue systems. This is insufficient for training intermediate dialogue turns since supervision signals (or rewards) are only provided at the end of dialogues. To address this issue, reward learning has been introduced to learn from state-action pairs of an optimal policy to provide turn-by-turn rewards. This approach requires complete state-action annotations of human-to-human dialogues (i.e., expert demonstrations), which is labor intensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel reward learning approach for semisupervised policy learning. The proposed approach learns a dynamics model as the reward function which models dialogue progress (i.e., state-action sequences) based on expert demonstrations, either with or without annotations. The dynamics model computes rewards by predicting whether the dialogue progress is consistent with expert demonstrations. We further propose to learn action embeddings for a better generalization of the reward function.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Large Scale Multi-Actor Generative Dialog Modeling,"Non-goal oriented dialog agents (i.e. chatbots) aim to produce varying and engaging conversations with a user; however, they typically exhibit either inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all users. This paper addresses these issues by controlling an agent's persona upon generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the GENERATIVE CONVERSATION CONTROL model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model multi-turn conversations in the actor's persona.

In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and better emulate them in generated responses.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Conversational Word Embedding for Retrieval-Based Dialog System,"Human conversations contain many types of information, e.g., knowledge, common sense, and language habits. In this paper, we propose a conversational word embedding method named PR-Embedding, which utilizes the conversation pairs post, reply 1 to learn word embedding. Different from previous works, PR-Embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply. To catch the information among the pair, we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window, then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level. We evaluate the method on single-turn and multi-turn response selection tasks for retrieval-based dialog systems.

We then present a novel CG grounded policy learning framework that conducts dialog flow planning by graph traversal, which learns to identify a what-vertex and a how-vertex from the CG at each turn to guide response generation. In this way, we effectively leverage the CG to facilitate policy learning as follows: (1) it enables more effective long-term reward design, (2) it provides high-quality candidate actions, and (3) it gives us more control over the policy.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Dynamic Fusion Network for Multi-Domain End-to-end Task-Oriented Dialog,"Recent studies have shown remarkable success in end-to-end task-oriented dialog system. However, most neural models rely on large training data, which are only available for a certain number of task domains, such as navigation and scheduling. This makes it difficult to scalable for a new domain with limited labeled data. However, there has been relatively little research on how to effectively use data from all domains to improve the performance of each domain and also unseen domains. To this end, we investigate methods that can make explicit use of domain knowledge and introduce a shared-private network to learn shared and specific knowledge. In addition, we propose a novel Dynamic Fusion Network (DF-Net) which automatically exploit the relevance between the target domain and each domain. Results show that our model outperforms existing methods on multi-domain dialogue, giving the state-of-the-art in the literature. Besides, with little training data, we show its transferability by outperforming prior best model by 13.9% on average.","{'sequence': 'Recent studies have shown remarkable success in end-to-end task-oriented dialog system.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Speak to your Parser: Interactive Text-to-SQL with Natural Language Feedback,"We study the task of semantic parse correction with natural language feedback. Given a natural language utterance, most semantic parsing systems pose the problem as one-shot translation where the utterance is mapped to a corresponding logical form. In this paper, we investigate a more interactive scenario where humans can further interact with the system by providing free-form natural language feedback to correct the system when it generates an inaccurate interpretation of an initial utterance. We focus on natural language to SQL systems and construct, SPLASH, a dataset of utterances, incorrect SQL interpretations and the corresponding natural language feedback. We compare various reference models for the correction task and show that incorporating such a rich form of feedback can significantly improve the overall semantic parsing accuracy while retaining the flexibility of natural language interaction. While we estimated human correction accuracy is 81.5%, our best model achieves only 25.1%, which leaves a large gap for improvement in future research.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Unknown Intent Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model with an Application to Zero-shot Intent Classification,"User intent classification plays a vital role in dialogue systems. Since user intent may frequently change over time in many realistic scenarios, unknown (new) intent detection has become an essential problem, where the study has just begun. This paper proposes a semantic-enhanced Gaussian mixture model (SEG) for unknown intent detection. In particular, we model utterance embeddings with a Gaussian mixture distribution and inject dynamic class semantic information into Gaussian means, which enables learning more classconcentrated embeddings that help to facilitate downstream outlier detection. Coupled with a density-based outlier detection algorithm, SEG achieves competitive results on three real task-oriented dialogue datasets in two languages for unknown intent detection. On top of that, we propose to integrate SEG as an unknown intent identifier into existing generalized zero-shot intent classification models to improve their performance. A case study on a state-of-the-art method, ReCapsNet, shows that SEG can push the classification performance to a significantly higher level.","{'sequence': 'User intent classification plays a vital role in dialogue systems.

A learnable DST for any new domain requires a large amount of labeled indomain data and training from scratch. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Reinforced Multi-Domain State Generator (MERET). Our first contribution is to improve the DST accuracy. We enhance a neural model based DST generator with a reward manager, which is built on policy gradient reinforcement learning (R-L) to fine-tune the generator. With this change, we are able to improve the joint accuracy of DST from 48.79% to 50.91% on the Multi-WOZ corpus. Second, we explore to train a DST meta-learning model with a few domains as source domains and a new domain as target domain. We apply the model-agnostic metalearning (MAML) algorithm to DST and the obtained meta-learning model is used for new domain adaptation. Our experimental results show this solution is able to outperform the traditional training approach with extremely less training data in target domain.","{'sequence': 'A Dialogue State Tracker (DST) is a core component of a modular task-oriented dialogue system.

Automatic metrics and human evaluations of engagingness show the efficacy of our approach; in particular, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the existing IGC task, and our best performing model is almost on par with humans on the Image-Chat test set (preferred 47.7% of the time).","{'sequence': 'To achieve the long-term goal of machines being able to engage humans in conversation, our models should captivate the interest of their speaking partners.

Automatic metrics and human evaluations of engagingness show the efficacy of our approach; in particular, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the existing IGC task, and our best performing model is almost on par with humans on the Image-Chat test set (preferred 47.7% of the time).', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'System Demonstrations', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theme', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09607534855604172, 0.09554649144411087, 0.0921679362654686, 0.058989912271499634, 0.04882807284593582, 0.0443689301609993, 0.043054040521383286, 0.042329803109169006, 0.04163102060556412, 0.03848534822463989, 0.033909719437360764, 0.03361007943749428, 0.03346280753612518, 0.030009880661964417, 0.02910609357059002, 0.028351839631795883, 0.02694707363843918, 0.0261391568928957, 0.025745417922735214, 0.023626180365681648, 0.022587422281503677, 0.020265553146600723, 0.01959807239472866, 0.01753457449376583, 0.01672971248626709, 0.010899518616497517]}",0.09607534855604172,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.09607534855604172
Dialogue and Interactive Systems,KdConv: A Chinese Multi-domain Dialogue Dataset Towards Multi-turn Knowledge-driven Conversation,"The research of knowledge-driven conversational systems is largely limited due to the lack of dialog data which consists of multi-turn conversations on multiple topics and with knowledge annotations. In this paper, we propose a Chinese multi-domain knowledge-driven conversation dataset, KdConv, which grounds the topics in multi-turn conversations to knowledge graphs. Our corpus contains 4.5K conversations from three domains (film, music, and travel), and 86K utterances with an average turn number of 19.0. These conversations contain in-depth discussions on related topics and natural transition between multiple topics. To facilitate the following research on this corpus, we provide several benchmark models. Comparative results show that the models can be enhanced by introducing background knowledge, yet there is still a large space for leveraging knowledge to model multi-turn conversations for further research.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"Generate, Delete and Rewrite: A Three-Stage Framework for Improving Persona Consistency of Dialogue Generation","Maintaining a consistent personality in conversations is quite natural for human beings, but is still a non-trivial task for machines. The persona-based dialogue generation task is thus introduced to tackle the personalityinconsistent problem by incorporating explicit persona text into dialogue generation models. Despite the success of existing personabased models on generating human-like responses, their one-stage decoding framework can hardly avoid the generation of inconsistent persona words. In this work, we introduce a three-stage framework that employs a generate-delete-rewrite mechanism to delete inconsistent words from a generated response prototype and further rewrite it to a personality-consistent one. We carry out evaluations by both human and automatic metrics. Experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset show that our approach achieves good performance.","{'sequence': 'Maintaining a consistent personality in conversations is quite natural for human beings, but is still a non-trivial task for machines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Gated Convolutional Bidirectional Attention-based Model for Off-topic Spoken Response Detection,"Off-topic spoken response detection, the task aiming at predicting whether a response is offtopic for the corresponding prompt, is important for an automated speaking assessment system.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for offtopic spoken response detection with high offtopic recall on both seen and unseen prompts. We introduce a new model, Gated Convolutional Bidirectional Attention-based Model (GCBiA), which applies bi-attention mechanism and convolutions to extract topic words of prompts and key-phrases of responses, and introduces gated unit and residual connections between major layers to better represent the relevance of responses and prompts.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Guiding Variational Response Generator to Exploit Persona,"Leveraging persona information of users in Neural Response Generators (NRG) to perform personalized conversations has been considered as an attractive and important topic in the research of conversational agents over the past few years.

This paper proposes to adopt the personalityrelated characteristics of human conversations into variational response generators, by designing a specific conditional variational autoencoder based deep model with two new regularization terms employed to the loss function, so as to guide the optimization towards the direction of generating both persona-aware and relevant responses. Besides, to reasonably evaluate the performances of various persona modeling approaches, this paper further presents three direct persona-oriented metrics from different perspectives.

However, selfreported user rating suffers from bias and variance among different users. To alleviate this problem, we formulate dialog evaluation as a comparison task. We also propose an automatic evaluation model CMADE (Comparison Model for Automatic Dialog Evaluation) that automatically cleans self-reported user ratings as it trains on them. Specifically, we first use a self-supervised method to learn better dialog feature representation, and then use KNN and Shapley to remove confusing samples. Our experiments show that CMADE achieves 89.2% accuracy in the dialog comparison task.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Diversifying Dialogue Generation with Non-Conversational Text,"Neural network-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models strongly suffer from the lowdiversity problem when it comes to opendomain dialogue generation.

In this paper, we propose a new perspective to diversify dialogue generation by leveraging non-conversational text. Compared with bilateral conversations, nonconversational text are easier to obtain, more diverse and cover a much broader range of topics. We collect a large-scale nonconversational corpus from multi sources including forum comments, idioms and book snippets.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Multi-Agent Task-Oriented Dialog Policy Learning with Role-Aware Reward Decomposition,"Many studies have applied reinforcement learning to train a dialog policy and show great promise these years. One common approach is to employ a user simulator to obtain a large number of simulated user experiences for reinforcement learning algorithms. However, modeling a realistic user simulator is challenging. A rule-based simulator requires heavy domain expertise for complex tasks, and a data-driven simulator requires considerable data and it is even unclear how to evaluate a simulator. To avoid explicitly building a user simulator beforehand, we propose Multi-Agent Dialog Policy Learning, which regards both the system and the user as the dialog agents. Two agents interact with each other and are jointly learned simultaneously. The method uses the actorcritic framework to facilitate pretraining and improve scalability. We also propose Hybrid Value Network for the role-aware reward decomposition to integrate role-specific domain knowledge of each agent in task-oriented dialog. Results show that our method can successfully build a system policy and a user policy simultaneously, and two agents can achieve a high task success rate through conversational interaction.","{'sequence': 'Many studies have applied reinforcement learning to train a dialog policy and show great promise these years.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Diverse and Informative Dialogue Generation with Context-Specific Commonsense Knowledge Awareness,"Generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses, which often leads to boring conversations. For alleviating this issue, Recent studies proposed to retrieve and introduce knowledge facts from knowledge graphs. While this paradigm works to a certain extent, it usually retrieves knowledge facts only based on the entity word itself, without considering the specific dialogue context. Thus, the introduction of the context-irrelevant knowledge facts can impact the quality of generations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel commonsense knowledge-aware dialogue generation model, ConKADI. We design a Felicitous Fact mechanism to help the model focus on the knowledge facts that are highly relevant to the context; furthermore, two techniques, Context-Knowledge Fusion and Flexible Mode Fusion are proposed to facilitate the integration of the knowledge in the ConKADI. We collect and build a large-scale Chinese dataset aligned with the commonsense knowledge for dialogue generation. Extensive evaluations over both an open-released English dataset and our Chinese dataset demonstrate that our approach ConKADI outperforms the state-of-the-art approach CCM, in most experiments.","{'sequence': 'Generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses, which often leads to boring conversations.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Efficient Dialogue State Tracking by Selectively Overwriting Memory,"Recent works in dialogue state tracking (DST)   focus on an open vocabulary-based setting to resolve scalability and generalization issues of the predefined ontology-based approaches. However, they are inefficient in that they predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder. This enhances the effectiveness of training and DST performance. Our SOM-DST (Selectively Overwriting Memory for Dialogue State Tracking) model achieves state-of-theart joint goal accuracy with 51.72% in Mul-tiWOZ 2.0 and 53.01% in MultiWOZ 2.1 in an open vocabulary-based DST setting. In addition, we analyze the accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations and suggest that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance. 1","{'sequence': 'Recent works in dialogue state tracking (DST)   focus on an open vocabulary-based setting to resolve scalability and generalization issues of the predefined ontology-based approaches.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,A Contextual Hierarchical Attention Network with Adaptive Objective for Dialogue State Tracking,"Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs. However, most of them have limitations to efficiently exploit relevant context due to the lack of a powerful mechanism for modeling interactions between the slot and the dialogue history. Besides, existing methods usually ignore the slot imbalance problem and treat all slots indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard slots and eventually hurts overall performance. In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations. We further propose an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training. Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new stateof-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%). 1","{'sequence': 'Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Speaker Sensitive Response Evaluation Model,"Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue response generation is very challenging because there are many appropriate responses for a given context. Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth.

In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled conversation corpus.

We use a Twitter conversation corpus that contains many speakers and conversations to test our evaluation model. Experiments show that our model outperforms the other existing evaluation metrics in terms of high correlation with human annotation scores. We also show that our model trained on Twitter can be applied to movie dialogues without any additional training.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Few-shot Slot Tagging with Collapsed Dependency Transfer and Label-enhanced Task-adaptive Projection Network,"In this paper, we explore the slot tagging with only a few labeled support sentences (a.k.a. few-shot). Few-shot slot tagging faces a unique challenge compared to the other fewshot classification problems as it calls for modeling the dependencies between labels. But it is hard to apply previously learned label dependencies to an unseen domain, due to the discrepancy of label sets. To tackle this, we introduce a collapsed dependency transfer mechanism into the conditional random field (CRF) to transfer abstract label dependency patterns as transition scores. In the few-shot setting, the emission score of CRF can be calculated as a word's similarity to the representation of each label. To calculate such similarity, we propose a Label-enhanced Task-Adaptive Projection Network (L-TapNet) based on the stateof-the-art few-shot classification model -Tap-Net, by leveraging label name semantics in representing labels.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Zero-Shot Transfer Learning with Synthesized Data for Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking,Zero-shot transfer learning for multi-domain dialogue state tracking can allow us to handle new domains without incurring the high cost of data acquisition. This paper proposes new zero-short transfer learning technique for dialogue state tracking where the in-domain training data are all synthesized from an abstract dialogue model and the ontology of the domain. We show that data augmentation through synthesized data can improve the accuracy of zero-shot learning for both the TRADE model and the BERT-based SUMBT model on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. We show training with only synthesized in-domain data on the SUMBT model can reach about 2/3 of the accuracy obtained with the full training dataset. We improve the zero-shot learning state of the art on average across domains by 21%.,"{'sequence': 'Zero-shot transfer learning for multi-domain dialogue state tracking can allow us to handle new domains without incurring the high cost of data acquisition.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Can You Put it All Together: Evaluating Conversational Agents' Ability to Blend Skills,"Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent. Previous work has introduced tasks and datasets that aim to help agents to learn those qualities in isolation and gauge how well they can express them. But rather than being specialized in one single quality, a good open-domain conversational agent should be able to seamlessly blend them all into one cohesive conversational flow. In this work, we investigate several ways to combine models trained towards isolated capabilities, ranging from simple model aggregation schemes that require minimal additional training, to various forms of multi-task training that encompass several skills at all training stages. We further propose a new dataset, Blended-SkillTalk, to analyze how these capabilities would mesh together in a natural conversation, and compare the performance of different architectures and training schemes. Our experiments show that multi-tasking over several tasks that focus on particular capabilities results in better blended conversation performance compared to models trained on a single skill, and that both unified or two-stage approaches perform well if they are constructed to avoid unwanted bias in skill selection or are fine-tuned on our new task.","{'sequence': 'Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning to Customize Model Structures for Few-shot Dialogue Generation Tasks,"Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems. Existing methods tend to use the meta-learning framework which pre-trains the parameters on all non-target tasks then fine-tunes on the target task. However, fine-tuning distinguishes tasks from the parameter perspective but ignores the model-structure perspective, resulting in similar dialogue models for different tasks. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can customize a unique dialogue model for each task in the few-shot setting. In our approach, each dialogue model consists of a shared module, a gating module, and a private module. The first two modules are shared among all the tasks, while the third one will differentiate into different network structures to better capture the characteristics of the corresponding task. The extensive experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms all the baselines in terms of task consistency, response quality, and diversity.","{'sequence': 'Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Dialogue Coherence Assessment Without Explicit Dialogue Act Labels,"Recent dialogue coherence models use the coherence features designed for monologue texts, e.g. nominal entities, to represent utterances and then explicitly augment them with dialogue-relevant features, e.g., dialogue act labels. It indicates two drawbacks, (a) semantics of utterances is limited to entity mentions, and (b) the performance of coherence models strongly relies on the quality of the input dialogue act labels. We address these issues by introducing a novel approach to dialogue coherence assessment. We use dialogue act prediction as an auxiliary task in a multi-task learning scenario to obtain informative utterance representations for coherence assessment. Our approach alleviates the need for explicit dialogue act labels during evaluation. The results of our experiments show that our model substantially (more than 20 accuracy points) outperforms its strong competitors on the Dai-lyDialogue corpus, and performs on par with them on the SwitchBoard corpus for ranking dialogues concerning their coherence.

Discourse and Pragmatics,Harnessing the linguistic signal to predict scalar inferences,"Pragmatic inferences often subtly depend on the presence or absence of linguistic features. For example, the presence of a partitive construction (of the) increases the strength of a so-called scalar inference: listeners perceive the inference that Chris did not eat all of the cookies to be stronger after hearing ""Chris ate some of the cookies"" than after hearing the same utterance without a partitive, ""Chris ate some cookies"". In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an LSTM-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r = 0.78). We then probe the model's behavior using manually constructed minimal sentence pairs and corpus data. We find that the model inferred previously established associations between linguistic features and inference strength, suggesting that the model learns to use linguistic features to predict pragmatic inferences.","{'sequence': 'Pragmatic inferences often subtly depend on the presence or absence of linguistic features.

In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an LSTM-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r = 0.78). We then probe the model\'s behavior using manually constructed minimal sentence pairs and corpus data. We find that the model inferred previously established associations between linguistic features and inference strength, suggesting that the model learns to use linguistic features to predict pragmatic inferences.', 'labels': ['Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'System Demonstrations', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Extraction', 'Theme', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10804374516010284, 0.06728994846343994, 0.0664672926068306, 0.06637370586395264, 0.05207817256450653, 0.04814039170742035, 0.04526620730757713, 0.039378054440021515, 0.03871140629053116, 0.036529943346977234, 0.036095838993787766, 0.03494982793927193, 0.03453325480222702, 0.032641973346471786, 0.032205644994974136, 0.03132236748933792, 0.028249656781554222, 0.028200633823871613, 0.02733745612204075, 0.027334222570061684, 0.025255883112549782, 0.022806663066148758, 0.02036791294813156, 0.019451487809419632, 0.018099768087267876, 0.012868506833910942]}",0.10804374516010284,Discourse and Pragmatics,0.10804374516010284
Discourse and Pragmatics,A Top-down Neural Architecture towards Text-level Parsing of Discourse Rhetorical Structure,"Due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years. However, all the previous studies on text-level discourse parsing adopt bottom-up approaches, which much limit the DRS determination on local information and fail to well benefit from global information of the overall discourse. In this paper, we justify from both computational and perceptive points-of-view that the top-down architecture is more suitable for textlevel DRS parsing. On the basis, we propose a top-down neural architecture toward text-level DRS parsing. In particular, we cast discourse parsing as a recursive split point ranking task, where a split point is classified to different levels according to its rank and the elementary discourse units (EDUs) associated with it are arranged accordingly. In this way, we can determine the complete DRS as a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack. Experimentation on both the English RST-DT corpus and the Chinese CDTB corpus shows the great effectiveness of our proposed top-down approach towards textlevel DRS parsing.","{'sequence': 'Due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years.

Ethics and NLP,Towards Debiasing Sentence Representations,"As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes. Previous work has revealed the presence of social biases in widely used word embeddings involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. While some methods were proposed to debias these word-level embeddings, there is a need to perform debiasing at the sentence-level given the recent shift towards new contextualized sentence representations such as ELMo and BERT. In this paper, we investigate the presence of social biases in sentence-level representations and propose a new method, SENT-DEBIAS, to reduce these biases. We show that SENT-DEBIAS is effective in removing biases, and at the same time, preserves performance on sentence-level downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and natural language understanding. We hope that our work will inspire future research on characterizing and removing social biases from widely adopted sentence representations for fairer NLP.","{'sequence': 'As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes.

Ethics and NLP,Demographics Should Not Be the Reason of Toxicity: Mitigating Discrimination in Text Classifications with Instance Weighting,"With the recent proliferation of the use of text classifications, researchers have found that there are certain unintended biases in text classification datasets. For example, texts containing some demographic identity-terms (e.g., ""gay"", ""black"") are more likely to be abusive in existing abusive language detection datasets. As a result, models trained with these datasets may consider sentences like ""She makes me happy to be gay"" as abusive simply because of the word ""gay."" In this paper, we formalize the unintended biases in text classification datasets as a kind of selection bias from the non-discrimination distribution to the discrimination distribution. Based on this formalization, we further propose a model-agnostic debiasing training framework by recovering the non-discrimination distribution using instance weighting, which does not require any extra resources or annotations apart from a pre-defined set of demographic identity-terms. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively alleviate the impacts of the unintended biases without significantly hurting models' generalization ability.","{'sequence': 'With the recent proliferation of the use of text classifications, researchers have found that there are certain unintended biases in text classification datasets.

Ethics and NLP,Social Bias Frames: Reasoning about Social and Power Implications of Language,"Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES from unstructured text. We find that while stateof-the-art neural models are effective at highlevel categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F 1 ), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.","{'sequence': 'Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.

Ethics and NLP,Is Your Classifier Actually Biased? Measuring Fairness under Uncertainty with Bernstein Bounds,"Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity). However, manually annotating a large dataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating all the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to estimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated sample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias. In this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty about the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence that a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true bias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call Bernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed biased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim. Our findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific biases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious cases. For example, consider a coreference resolution system that is 5% more accurate on gender-stereotypical sentences -to claim it is biased with 95% confidence, we need a bias-specific dataset that is 3.8 times larger than WinoBias, the largest available.","{'sequence': 'Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity).

Ethics and NLP,Double-Hard Debias: Tailoring Word Embeddings for Gender Bias Mitigation,"Word embeddings derived from humangenerated corpora inherit strong gender bias which can be further amplified by downstream models. Some commonly adopted debiasing approaches, including the seminal Hard Debias algorithm (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) , apply post-processing procedures that project pre-trained word embeddings into a subspace orthogonal to an inferred gender subspace. We discover that semantic-agnostic corpus regularities such as word frequency captured by the word embeddings negatively impact the performance of these algorithms. We propose a simple but effective technique, Double-Hard Debias, which purifies the word embeddings against such corpus regularities prior to inferring and removing the gender subspace. Experiments on three bias mitigation benchmarks show that our approach preserves the distributional semantics of the pre-trained word embeddings while reducing gender bias to a significantly larger degree than prior approaches.","{'sequence': 'Word embeddings derived from humangenerated corpora inherit strong gender bias which can be further amplified by downstream models.

Ethics and NLP,Gender Bias in Multilingual Embeddings and Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Multilingual representations embed words from many languages into a single semantic space such that words with similar meanings are close to each other regardless of the language. These embeddings have been widely used in various settings, such as cross-lingual transfer, where a natural language processing (NLP) model trained on one language is deployed to another language. While the crosslingual transfer techniques are powerful, they carry gender bias from the source to target languages. In this paper, we study gender bias in multilingual embeddings and how it affects transfer learning for NLP applications. We create a multilingual dataset for bias analysis and propose several ways for quantifying bias in multilingual representations from both the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives. Experimental results show that the magnitude of bias in the multilingual representations changes differently when we align the embeddings to different target spaces and that the alignment direction can also have an influence on the bias in transfer learning.

Ethics and NLP,Towards Understanding Gender Bias in Relation Extraction,"Recent developments in Neural Relation Extraction (NRE) have made significant strides towards automated knowledge base construction. While much attention has been dedicated towards improvements in accuracy, there have been no attempts in the literature to evaluate social biases exhibited in NRE systems. In this paper, we create WikiGenderBias, a distantly supervised dataset composed of over 45,000 sentences including a 10% human annotated test set for the purpose of analyzing gender bias in relation extraction systems. We find that when extracting spouse and hypernym (i.e., occupation) relations, an NRE system performs differently when the gender of the target entity is different. However, such disparity does not appear when extracting relations such as birth date or birth place. We also analyze two existing bias mitigation techniques, word embedding debiasing and data augmentation. Unfortunately, due to NRE models relying heavily on surface level cues, we find that existing bias mitigation approaches have a negative effect on NRE. Our analysis lays groundwork for future quantifying and mitigating bias in relation extraction.","{'sequence': 'Recent developments in Neural Relation Extraction (NRE) have made significant strides towards automated knowledge base construction.

Generation,A Knowledge-Enhanced Pretraining Model for Commonsense Story Generation,"Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task. In spite of the success in modeling fluency and local coherence, existing neural language generation models (e.g., GPT-2) still suffer from repetition, logic conflicts, and lack of long-range coherence in generated stories. We conjecture that this is because of the difficulty of associating relevant commonsense knowledge, understanding the causal relationships, and planning entities and events with proper temporal order. In this paper, we devise a knowledge-enhanced pretraining model for commonsense story generation. We propose to utilize commonsense knowledge from external knowledge bases to generate reasonable stories. To further capture the causal and temporal dependencies between the sentences in a reasonable story, we use multi-task learning, which combines a discriminative objective to distinguish true and fake stories during fine-tuning. Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more reasonable stories than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in terms of logic and global coherence.","{'sequence': 'Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task.

Rather than dealing with individual words, our method treats the story so far as a list of pre-trained sentence embeddings and predicts an embedding for the next sentence, which is more efficient than predicting word embeddings. Notably this allows us to consider a large number of candidates for the next sentence during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art accuracy on the unsupervised Story Cloze task and with promising results on larger-scale next sentence prediction tasks.","{'sequence': 'We propose a sentence-level language model which selects the next sentence in a story from a finite set of fluent alternatives.

Generation,Semantic Graphs for Generating Deep Questions,"This paper proposes the problem of Deep Question Generation (DQG), which aims to generate complex questions that require reasoning over multiple pieces of information of the input passage. In order to capture the global structure of the document and facilitate reasoning, we propose a novel framework which first constructs a semantic-level graph for the input document and then encodes the semantic graph by introducing an attention-based GGNN (Att-GGNN). Afterwards, we fuse the document-level and graphlevel representations to perform joint training of content selection and question decoding. On the HotpotQA deep-question centric dataset, our model greatly improves performance over questions requiring reasoning over multiple facts, leading to state-of-theart performance.

Generation,Bridging the Structural Gap Between Encoding and Decoding for Data-To-Text Generation,"Generating sequential natural language descriptions from graph-structured data (e.g., knowledge graph) is challenging, partly because of the structural differences between the input graph and the output text. Hence, popular sequence-to-sequence models, which require serialized input, are not a natural fit for this task. Graph neural networks, on the other hand, can better encode the input graph but broaden the structural gap between the encoder and decoder, making faithful generation difficult. To narrow this gap, we propose DUA-LENC, a dual encoding model that can not only incorporate the graph structure, but can also cater to the linear structure of the output text. Empirical comparisons with strong single-encoder baselines demonstrate that dual encoding can significantly improve the quality of the generated text.","{'sequence': 'Generating sequential natural language descriptions from graph-structured data (e.g., knowledge graph) is challenging, partly because of the structural differences between the input graph and the output text.

Generation,Politeness Transfer: A Tag and Generate Approach,"This paper introduces a new task of politeness transfer which involves converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning. We also provide a dataset of more than 1.39 million instances automatically labeled for politeness to encourage benchmark evaluations on this new task. We design a tag and generate pipeline that identifies stylistic attributes and subsequently generates a sentence in the target style while preserving most of the source content. For politeness as well as five other transfer tasks, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics for content preservation, with a comparable or better performance on style transfer accuracy. Additionally, our model surpasses existing methods on human evaluations for grammaticality, meaning preservation and transfer accuracy across all the six style transfer tasks. The data and code is located at https:// github.com/tag-and-generate/ Introduction Politeness plays a crucial role in social interaction, and is closely tied with power dynamics, social distance between the participants of a conversation, and gender (Brown et al., 1987; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013) . It is also imperative to use the appropriate level of politeness for smooth communication in conversations (Coppock, 2005) , organizational settings like emails (Peterson et al., 2011) , memos, official documents, and many other settings. Notably, politeness has also been identified as an interpersonal style which can be decoupled from content (Kang and Hovy, 2019). Motivated by its central importance, in this paper we study the task of converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning.","{'sequence': 'This paper introduces a new task of politeness transfer which involves converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning.

We further show our model's scalability by conducting tests on the CoQA dataset. 1"", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'System Demonstrations', 'Theme', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Student Research Workshop', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Summarization', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.3844142258167267, 0.0549812875688076, 0.04713355004787445, 0.0416591577231884, 0.04122557491064072, 0.037659768015146255, 0.0364568755030632, 0.027524258941411972, 0.027143554762005806, 0.02542915940284729, 0.025402264669537544, 0.02197149023413658, 0.021781468763947487, 0.02152719907462597, 0.020124919712543488, 0.018620889633893967, 0.018530497327446938, 0.017472093924880028, 0.016350623220205307, 0.016307441517710686, 0.015534142032265663, 0.014312203973531723, 0.013923732563853264, 0.013540955260396004, 0.012254944071173668, 0.008717735297977924]}",0.3844142258167267,Question Answering,0.0549812875688076
Generation,Structural Information Preserving for Graph-to-Text Generation,"The task of graph-to-text generation aims at producing sentences that preserve the meaning of input graphs. As a crucial defect, the current state-of-the-art models may mess up or even drop the core structural information of input graphs when generating outputs. We propose to tackle this problem by leveraging richer training signals that can guide our model for preserving input information. In particular, we introduce two types of autoencoding losses, each individually focusing on different aspects (a.k.a. views) of input graphs. The losses are then back-propagated to better calibrate our model via multi-task training. Experiments on two benchmarks for graph-to-text generation show the effectiveness of our approach over a state-of-the-art baseline.

Generation,Syn-QG: Syntactic and Shallow Semantic Rules for Question Generation,"Question Generation (QG) is fundamentally a simple syntactic transformation; however, many aspects of semantics influence what questions are good to form. We implement this observation by developing Syn-QG, a set of transparent syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies, shallow semantic parsing, lexical resources, and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into questionanswer pairs. We utilize PropBank argument descriptions and VerbNet state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content, which helps generate questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically richer questions than existing systems. In order to improve syntactic fluency and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions, we employ back-translation over the output of these syntactic rules.

Generation,Rigid Formats Controlled Text Generation,"Neural text generation has made tremendous progress in various tasks. One common characteristic of most of the tasks is that the texts are not restricted to some rigid formats when generating. However, we may confront some special text paradigms such as Lyrics (assume the music score is given), Sonnet, SongCi (classical Chinese poetry of the Song dynasty), etc. The typical characteristics of these texts are in three folds: (1) They must comply fully with the rigid predefined formats. (2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3) Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated. Therefore, we propose a simple and elegant framework named SongNet to tackle this problem. The backbone of the framework is a Transformer-based auto-regressive language model. Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity. We improve the attention mechanism to impel the model to capture some future information on the format. A pre-training and fine-tuning framework is designed to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments conducted on two collected corpora demonstrate that our proposed framework generates significantly better results in terms of both automatic metrics and the human evaluation. 1","{'sequence': 'Neural text generation has made tremendous progress in various tasks.

Generation,Neural Syntactic Preordering for Controlled Paraphrase Generation,"Paraphrasing natural language sentences is a multifaceted process: it might involve replacing individual words or short phrases, local rearrangement of content, or high-level restructuring like topicalization or passivization. Past approaches struggle to cover this space of paraphrase possibilities in an interpretable manner. Our work, inspired by pre-ordering literature in machine translation, uses syntactic transformations to softly ""reorder"" the source sentence and guide our neural paraphrasing model. First, given an input sentence, we derive a set of feasible syntactic rearrangements using an encoder-decoder model. This model operates over a partially lexical, partially syntactic view of the sentence and can reorder big chunks. Next, we use each proposed rearrangement to produce a sequence of position embeddings, which encourages our final encoder-decoder paraphrase model to attend to the source words in a particular order. Our evaluation, both automatic and human, shows that the proposed system retains the quality of the baseline approaches while giving a substantial increase in the diversity of the generated paraphrases. 1","{'sequence': 'Paraphrasing natural language sentences is a multifaceted process: it might involve replacing individual words or short phrases, local rearrangement of content, or high-level restructuring like topicalization or passivization.

Generation,Towards Faithful Neural Table-to-Text Generation with Content-Matching Constraints,"Text generation from a knowledge base aims to translate knowledge triples to naturallanguage descriptions. Most existing methods ignore the faithfulness between a generated text description and the original table, leading to generated information that goes beyond the content of the table. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel Transformerbased generation framework to achieve the goal. The core techniques in our method to enforce faithfulness include a new table-text optimal-transport matching loss and a tabletext embedding similarity loss based on the Transformer model. Furthermore, to evaluate faithfulness, we propose a new automatic metric specialized to the table-to-text generation problem. We also provide detailed analysis on each component of our model in our experiments. Automatic and human evaluations show that our framework can significantly outperform state-of-the-art by a large margin.","{'sequence': 'Text generation from a knowledge base aims to translate knowledge triples to naturallanguage descriptions.

Generation,Neural CRF Model for Sentence Alignment in Text Simplification,"The success of a text simplification system heavily depends on the quality and quantity of complex-simple sentence pairs in the training corpus, which are extracted by aligning sentences between parallel articles.

Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the previous work on monolingual sentence alignment task by more than 5 points in F1.

Generation,Expertise Style Transfer: A New Task Towards Better Communication between Experts and Laymen,"The curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen. We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. Solving this task not only simplifies the professional language, but also improves the accuracy and expertise level of laymen descriptions using simple words. This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five stateof-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github. io/expertise-style-transfer/. Many cause dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or both. The most common symptoms, regardless of the type of fluid in the pleural space or its cause, are shortness of breath and chest pain. About 1/1000 hypertensive patients has a pheochromocytoma. The incidence of Pheochromocytomas may be quite small. The lesion slowly enlarges, often ulcerates, and spread to other skin areas. Lesions heal slowly, with scarring. The sores slowly enlarge and spread to nearby tissue, causing further damage. Sores heal slowly and may result in permanent scarring. In patients with papilledema, vision is usually not affected initially, but seconds-long graying out of vision, flickering, or blurred or double vision may occur.

We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. Solving this task not only simplifies the professional language, but also improves the accuracy and expertise level of laymen descriptions using simple words. This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five stateof-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github. io/expertise-style-transfer/. Many cause dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or both. The most common symptoms, regardless of the type of fluid in the pleural space or its cause, are shortness of breath and chest pain. About 1/1000 hypertensive patients has a pheochromocytoma. The incidence of Pheochromocytomas may be quite small. The lesion slowly enlarges, often ulcerates, and spread to other skin areas. Lesions heal slowly, with scarring. The sores slowly enlarge and spread to nearby tissue, causing further damage. Sores heal slowly and may result in permanent scarring. In patients with papilledema, vision is usually not affected initially, but seconds-long graying out of vision, flickering, or blurred or double vision may occur.

Generation,Improving Image Captioning with Better Use of Caption,"Image captioning is a multimodal problem that has drawn extensive attention in both the natural language processing and computer vision community. In this paper, we present a novel image captioning architecture to better explore semantics available in captions and leverage that to enhance both image representation and caption generation. Our models first construct caption-guided visual relationship graphs that introduce beneficial inductive bias using weakly supervised multi-instance learning. The representation is then enhanced with neighbouring and contextual nodes with their textual and visual features. During generation, the model further incorporates visual relationships using multi-task learning for jointly predicting word and object/predicate tag sequences. We perform extensive experiments on the MSCOCO dataset, showing that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the baselines, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of evaluation metrics.

Generation,Generating Diverse and Consistent QA pairs from Contexts with Information-Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional VAEs,"One of the most crucial challenges in question answering (QA) is the scarcity of labeled data, since it is costly to obtain question-answer (QA) pairs for a target text domain with human annotation.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE) for generating QA pairs given unstructured texts as contexts, while maximizing the mutual information between generated QA pairs to ensure their consistency. We validate our Information Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (Info-HCVAE) on several benchmark datasets by evaluating the performance of the QA model (BERT-base) using only the generated QA pairs (QA-based evaluation) or by using both the generated and human-labeled pairs (semisupervised learning) for training, against stateof-the-art baseline models.

Experimental results show that our model strongly outperforms the state of the art on all four standard benchmarks of AMRto-text generation and syntax-based neural machine translation.', 'labels': ['Generation', 'System Demonstrations', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Summarization', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.10426875948905945, 0.08157487958669662, 0.07321633398532867, 0.06465145945549011, 0.05376466363668442, 0.04816776514053345, 0.044679515063762665, 0.04427533224225044, 0.0425838977098465, 0.04198203980922699, 0.03974078595638275, 0.038556262850761414, 0.03580057993531227, 0.030461564660072327, 0.027656923979520798, 0.026819242164492607, 0.02552240528166294, 0.025179125368595123, 0.024660229682922363, 0.024316811934113503, 0.021186718717217445, 0.02116359956562519, 0.01905490644276142, 0.016207585111260414, 0.013962955214083195, 0.010545658878982067]}",0.10426875948905945,Generation,0.10426875948905945
Generation,One Size Does Not Fit All: Generating and Evaluating Variable Number of Keyphrases,"Different texts shall by nature correspond to different number of keyphrases. This desideratum is largely missing from existing neural keyphrase generation models. In this study, we address this problem from both modeling and evaluation perspectives. We first propose a recurrent generative model that generates multiple keyphrases as delimiter-separated sequences. Generation diversity is further enhanced with two novel techniques by manipulating decoder hidden states. In contrast to previous approaches, our model is capable of generating diverse keyphrases and controlling number of outputs. We further propose two evaluation metrics tailored towards the variable-number generation. We also introduce a new dataset (ST A C KEX) that expands beyond the only existing genre (i.e., academic writing) in keyphrase generation tasks.

Generation,Improved Natural Language Generation via Loss Truncation,"Neural language models are usually trained to match the distributional properties of largescale corpora by minimizing the log loss. While straightforward to optimize, this approach forces the model to reproduce all variations in the dataset, including noisy and invalid references (e.g., misannotations and hallucinated facts).

As an alternative, prior work has shown that minimizing the distinguishability of generated samples is a principled and robust loss that can handle invalid references. However, distinguishability has not been used in practice due to challenges in optimization and estimation. We propose loss truncation: a simple and scalable procedure which adaptively removes high log loss examples as a way to optimize for distinguishability. Empirically, we demonstrate that loss truncation outperforms existing baselines on distinguishability on a summarization task. Furthermore, we show that samples generated by the loss truncation model have factual accuracy ratings that exceed those of baselines and match human references.","{'sequence': 'Neural language models are usually trained to match the distributional properties of largescale corpora by minimizing the log loss.

Generation,Automatic Poetry Generation from Prosaic Text,"In the last few years, a number of successful approaches have emerged that are able to adequately model various aspects of natural language. In particular, language models based on neural networks have improved the state of the art with regard to predictive language modeling, while topic models are successful at capturing clear-cut, semantic dimensions. In this paper, we explore how these approaches can be adapted and combined to model the linguistic and literary aspects needed for poetry generation. The system is exclusively trained on standard, non-poetic text, and its output is constrained in order to confer a poetic character to the generated verse. The framework is applied to the generation of poems in both English and French, and is equally evaluated for both languages.

To this end, we train (or fine-tune) off-the-shelf LMs on sequences containing the concatenation of artificially-masked text and the text which was masked. We show that this approach, which we call infilling by language modeling, can enable LMs to infill entire sentences effectively on three different domains: short stories, scientific abstracts, and lyrics.

Generation,Line Graph Enhanced AMR-to-Text Generation with Mix-Order Graph Attention Networks,"Efficient structure encoding for graphs with labeled edges is an important yet challenging point in many graph-based models. This work focuses on AMR-to-text generation -A graph-to-sequence task aiming to recover natural language from Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR). Existing graph-to-sequence approaches generally utilize graph neural networks as their encoders, which have two limitations: 1) The message propagation process in AMR graphs is only guided by the firstorder adjacency information. 2) The relationships between labeled edges are not fully considered.

Generation,Review-based Question Generation with Adaptive Instance Transfer and Augmentation,"While online reviews of products and services become an important information source, it remains inefficient for potential consumers to exploit verbose reviews for fulfilling their information need. We propose to explore question generation as a new way of review information exploitation, namely generating questions that can be answered by the corresponding review sentences. One major challenge of this generation task is the lack of training data, i.e. explicit mapping relation between the user-posed questions and review sentences. To obtain proper training instances for the generation model, we propose an iterative learning framework with adaptive instance transfer and augmentation. To generate to the point questions about the major aspects in reviews, related features extracted in an unsupervised manner are incorporated without the burden of aspect annotation.

Generation,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by ( 1 ) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new stateof-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance. 1","{'sequence': 'We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models.

In the spirit of better understanding generative text models and their artifacts, we propose the new task of distinguishing which of several variants of a given model generated a piece of text, and we conduct an extensive suite of diagnostic tests to observe whether modeling choices (e.g., sampling methods, top-k probabilities, model architectures, etc.) leave detectable artifacts in the text they generate.

Generation,Automatic Detection of Generated Text is Easiest when Humans are Fooled,"Recent advancements in neural language modelling make it possible to rapidly generate vast amounts of human-sounding text. The capabilities of humans and automatic discriminators to detect machine-generated text have been a large source of research interest, but humans and machines rely on different cues to make their decisions. Here, we perform careful benchmarking and analysis of three popular sampling-based decoding strategies-topk, nucleus sampling, and untruncated random sampling-and show that improvements in decoding methods have primarily optimized for fooling humans. This comes at the expense of introducing statistical abnormalities that make detection easy for automatic systems. We also show that though both human and automatic detector performance improve with longer excerpt length, even multi-sentence excerpts can fool expert human raters over 30% of the time. Our findings reveal the importance of using both human and automatic detectors to assess the humanness of text generation systems.","{'sequence': 'Recent advancements in neural language modelling make it possible to rapidly generate vast amounts of human-sounding text.

It requires no labeled data from the target domain, making it completely unsupervised. Experiments with two domains (English literature and news) show that ADA leads to an average F1 score improvement of 3.9 on outof-domain data. Our best performing model (BERT-A) reaches 44-49 F1 across both domains, using no labeled target data.

Information Extraction,Relabel the Noise: Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations via Cooperative Multiagents,"Distant supervision based methods for entity and relation extraction have received increasing popularity due to the fact that these methods require light human annotation efforts. In this paper, we consider the problem of shifted label distribution, which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set, and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. We propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents. To handle noisy instances in a fine-grained manner, each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective; To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. Further, the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors. Experimental results on two realworld datasets verify the benefits of re-labeling noisy instance, and show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art entity and relation extraction methods.","{'sequence': 'Distant supervision based methods for entity and relation extraction have received increasing popularity due to the fact that these methods require light human annotation efforts.

To handle noisy instances in a fine-grained manner, each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective; To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. Further, the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors. Experimental results on two realworld datasets verify the benefits of re-labeling noisy instance, and show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art entity and relation extraction methods.', 'labels': ['System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality'], 'scores': [0.0697198435664177, 0.06863398849964142, 0.06685525923967361, 0.06236936151981354, 0.06008141115307808, 0.054856885224580765, 0.05201089382171631, 0.04979221150279045, 0.04717184230685234, 0.04502693563699722, 0.041805997490882874, 0.03828619047999382, 0.03803292289376259, 0.037554334849119186, 0.03728132322430611, 0.029363267123699188, 0.027563350275158882, 0.02656014822423458, 0.024585401639342308, 0.022201022133231163, 0.019024765118956566, 0.018331632018089294, 0.017949489876627922, 0.015510473400354385, 0.014816745184361935, 0.014614388346672058]}",0.0697198435664177,System Demonstrations,0.05201089382171631

Information Extraction,Exploiting the Syntax-Model Consistency for Neural Relation Extraction,"This paper studies the task of Relation Extraction (RE) that aims to identify the semantic relations between two entity mentions in text. In the deep learning models for RE, it has been beneficial to incorporate the syntactic structures from the dependency trees of the input sentences. In such models, the dependency trees are often used to directly structure the network architectures or to obtain the dependency relations between the word pairs to inject the syntactic information into the models via multi-task learning. The major problems with these approaches are the lack of generalization beyond the syntactic structures in the training data or the failure to capture the syntactic importance of the words for RE. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning model for RE that uses the dependency trees to extract the syntax-based importance scores for the words, serving as a tree representation to introduce syntactic information into the models with greater generalization. In particular, we leverage Ordered-Neuron Long-Short Term Memory Networks (ON-LSTM) to infer the model-based importance scores for RE for every word in the sentences that are then regulated to be consistent with the syntax-based scores to enable syntactic information injection.

To support these experiments, we introduce a novel data set of English tweets annotated with named entities. 1 We empirically demonstrate the effect of temporal drift on performance, and how the temporal information of documents can be used to obtain better models compared to those that disregard temporal information.

To support these experiments, we introduce a novel data set of English tweets annotated with named entities. 1 We empirically demonstrate the effect of temporal drift on performance, and how the temporal information of documents can be used to obtain better models compared to those that disregard temporal information. Our analysis gives insights into why this information is useful, in the hope of informing potential avenues of improvement for named entity recognition as well as other NLP tasks under similar experimental setups.', 'labels': ['Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'System Demonstrations', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09541212022304535, 0.07331878691911697, 0.06410057842731476, 0.06383036822080612, 0.060584649443626404, 0.05638556554913521, 0.053957100957632065, 0.053725745528936386, 0.049353279173374176, 0.04080568626523018, 0.03885798901319504, 0.03401794284582138, 0.032374829053878784, 0.031999144703149796, 0.030819695442914963, 0.027784936130046844, 0.0260164774954319, 0.025317465886473656, 0.024420130997896194, 0.022886870428919792, 0.021257588639855385, 0.01820145919919014, 0.01752099208533764, 0.01589225046336651, 0.012810350395739079, 0.008348045870661736]}",0.09541212022304535,Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,0.04080568626523018

Information Extraction,A Novel Cascade Binary Tagging Framework for Relational Triple Extraction,"Extracting relational triples from unstructured text is crucial for large-scale knowledge graph construction. However, few existing works excel in solving the overlapping triple problem where multiple relational triples in the same sentence share the same entities. In this work, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the relational triple extraction task and propose a novel cascade binary tagging framework (CASREL) derived from a principled problem formulation. Instead of treating relations as discrete labels as in previous works, our new framework models relations as functions that map subjects to objects in a sentence, which naturally handles the overlapping problem. Experiments show that the CAS-REL framework already outperforms state-ofthe-art methods even when its encoder module uses a randomly initialized BERT encoder, showing the power of the new tagging framework. It enjoys further performance boost when employing a pre-trained BERT encoder, outperforming the strongest baseline by 17.5 and 30.2 absolute gain in F1-score on two public datasets NYT and WebNLG, respectively. In-depth analysis on different scenarios of overlapping triples shows that the method delivers consistent performance gain across all these scenarios.

Information Extraction,From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues,"Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing. The NLP community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios, but little attention has been given to CS in particular. This is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data, despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. In this paper, we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. Specifically, we transfer English knowledge from a pre-trained ELMo model to different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English) using the task of language identification. Our method, CS-ELMo, is an extension of ELMo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. We show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual BERT and homologous CS-unaware ELMo models and establishing a new state of the art in CS tasks, such as NER and POS tagging. Our technique can be expanded to more English-paired code-switched languages, providing more resources to the CS community.","{'sequence': 'Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing.

Information Extraction,Named Entity Recognition without Labelled Data: A Weak Supervision Approach,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training. When in-domain labelled data is available, transfer learning techniques can be used to adapt existing NER models to the target domain. But what should one do when there is no hand-labelled data for the target domain? This paper presents a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled data through weak supervision. The approach relies on a broad spectrum of labelling functions to automatically annotate texts from the target domain. These annotations are then merged together using a hidden Markov model which captures the varying accuracies and confusions of the labelling functions. A sequence labelling model can finally be trained on the basis of this unified annotation. We evaluate the approach on two English datasets (CoNLL 2003 and news articles from Reuters and Bloomberg) and demonstrate an improvement of about 7 percentage points in entity-level F 1 scores compared to an out-of-domain neural NER model.","{'sequence': 'Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training.

Information Extraction,Single-/Multi-Source Cross-Lingual NER via Teacher-Student Learning on Unlabeled Data in Target Language,"To better tackle the named entity recognition (NER) problem on languages with little/no labeled data, cross-lingual NER must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data. Previous works on cross-lingual NER are mostly based on label projection with pairwise texts or direct model transfer. However, such methods either are not applicable if the labeled data in the source languages is unavailable, or do not leverage information contained in unlabeled data in the target language. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method to address such limitations, where NER models in the source languages are used as teachers to train a student model on unlabeled data in the target language. The proposed method works for both single-source and multi-source crosslingual NER. For the latter, we further propose a similarity measuring method to better weight the supervision from different teacher models. Extensive experiments for 3 target languages on benchmark datasets well demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-theart methods for both single-source and multisource cross-lingual NER.","{'sequence': 'To better tackle the named entity recognition (NER) problem on languages with little/no labeled data, cross-lingual NER must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data.

Information Extraction,A Joint Neural Model for Information Extraction with Global Features,"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a VICTIM of a DIE event is likely to be a VICTIM of an AT-TACK event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, ONEIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. ONEIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state-of-the-art on all subtasks.

Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the realm of relatively high-resource languages, but these do not extend well to low-resource languages with few, if any, Wikipedia pages. Recently, transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in the lowresource languages by utilizing resources in closely related languages, but the performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate generation methods for low-resource XEL, then propose three improvements that (1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2) improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are simple, but effective: We experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets and find that they yield an average gain of 16.9% in TOP-30 gold candidate recall, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our improved model also yields an average gain of 7.9% in in-KB accuracy of end-to-end XEL. 1","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts.

Information Extraction,MIE: A Medical Information Extractor towards Medical Dialogues,"Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have become key components of modern medical care systems. Despite the merits of EMRs, many doctors suffer from writing them, which is time-consuming and tedious. We believe that automatically converting medical dialogues to EMRs can greatly reduce the burdens of doctors, and extracting information from medical dialogues is an essential step. To this end, we annotate online medical consultation dialogues in a window-sliding style, which is much easier than the sequential labeling annotation. We then propose a Medical Information Extractor (MIE) towards medical dialogues. MIE is able to extract mentioned symptoms, surgeries, tests, other information and their corresponding status. To tackle the particular challenges of the task, MIE uses a deep matching architecture, taking dialogue turn-interaction into account. The experimental results demonstrate MIE is a promising solution to extract medical information from doctor-patient dialogues. 1","{'sequence': 'Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have become key components of modern medical care systems.

Information Extraction,Document-Level Event Role Filler Extraction using Multi-Granularity Contextualized Encoding,"Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual sentences to make extraction decisions. This is problematic when the information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-toend neural sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context captured affects the models' performance. To dynamically aggregate information captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity (e.g., the sentence-and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show that our best system performs substantially better than prior work.

Information Extraction,FLAT: Chinese NER Using Flat-Lattice Transformer,"Recently, the character-word lattice structure has been proved to be effective for Chinese named entity recognition (NER) by incorporating the word information. However, since the lattice structure is complex and dynamic, most existing lattice-based models are hard to fully utilize the parallel computation of GPUs and usually have a low inference-speed. In this paper, we propose FLAT: Flat-LAttice Transformer for Chinese NER, which converts the lattice structure into a flat structure consisting of spans. Each span corresponds to a character or latent word and its position in the original lattice. With the power of Transformer and well-designed position encoding, FLAT can fully leverage the lattice information and has an excellent parallelization ability. Experiments on four datasets show FLAT outperforms other lexicon-based models in performance and efficiency.","{'sequence': 'Recently, the character-word lattice structure has been proved to be effective for Chinese named entity recognition (NER) by incorporating the word information.

The biaffine model scores pairs of start and end tokens in a sentence which we use to explore all spans, so that the model is able to predict named entities accurately.

We show that the model works well for both nested and flat NER through evaluation on 8 corpora and achieving SoTA performance on all of them, with accuracy gains of up to 2.2 percentage points.', 'labels': ['System Demonstrations', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theme', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Question Answering', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.12566795945167542, 0.10395273566246033, 0.07898944616317749, 0.05380653589963913, 0.04974447563290596, 0.04692791774868965, 0.04617151990532875, 0.04249783605337143, 0.039863381534814835, 0.03941670432686806, 0.035501714795827866, 0.03319039195775986, 0.03256434574723244, 0.03222625330090523, 0.031001638621091843, 0.025535309687256813, 0.024967990815639496, 0.02422591671347618, 0.023920057341456413, 0.02171485312283039, 0.021213140338659286, 0.019665785133838654, 0.01729157194495201, 0.014217937365174294, 0.010248549282550812, 0.005476054735481739]}",0.12566795945167542,System Demonstrations,0.04692791774868965
Information Extraction,Soft Gazetteers for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition,"Traditional named entity recognition models use gazetteers (lists of entities) as features to improve performance. Although modern neural network models do not require such handcrafted features for strong performance, recent work (Wu et al., 2018) has demonstrated their utility for named entity recognition on English data. However, designing such features for low-resource languages is challenging, because exhaustive entity gazetteers do not exist in these languages. To address this problem, we propose a method of ""soft gazetteers"" that incorporates ubiquitously available information from English knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, into neural named entity recognition models through cross-lingual entity linking. Our experiments on four low-resource languages show an average improvement of 4 points in F1 score. 1","{'sequence': 'Traditional named entity recognition models use gazetteers (lists of entities) as features to improve performance.

Information Extraction,Relation Extraction with Explanation,"Recent neural models for relation extraction with distant supervision alleviate the impact of irrelevant sentences in a bag by learning importance weights for the sentences. Efforts thus far have focused on improving extraction accuracy but little is known about their explainability. In this work we annotate a test set with ground-truth sentence-level explanations to evaluate the quality of explanations afforded by the relation extraction models. We demonstrate that replacing the entity mentions in the sentences with their fine-grained entity types not only enhances extraction accuracy but also improves explanation.

Information Extraction,Neighborhood Matching Network for Entity Alignment,"Structural heterogeneity between knowledge graphs is an outstanding challenge for entity alignment. This paper presents Neighborhood Matching Network (NMN), a novel entity alignment framework for tackling the structural heterogeneity challenge. NMN estimates the similarities between entities to capture both the topological structure and the neighborhood difference. It provides two innovative components for better learning representations for entity alignment. It first uses a novel graph sampling method to distill a discriminative neighborhood for each entity. It then adopts a cross-graph neighborhood matching module to jointly encode the neighborhood difference for a given entity pair. Such strategies allow NMN to effectively construct matchingoriented entity representations while ignoring noisy neighbors that have a negative impact on the alignment task. Extensive experiments performed on three entity alignment datasets show that NMN can well estimate the neighborhood similarity in more tough cases and significantly outperforms 12 previous state-ofthe-art methods.","{'sequence': 'Structural heterogeneity between knowledge graphs is an outstanding challenge for entity alignment.

Information Extraction,Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent Network for Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction,"Opinion entity extraction is a fundamental task in fine-grained opinion mining. Related studies generally extract aspects and/or opinion expressions without recognizing the relations between them. However, the relations are crucial for downstream tasks, including sentiment classification, opinion summarization, etc. In this paper, we explore Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) task, which aims at extracting aspects and opinion expressions in pairs. To deal with this task, we propose Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent Network (SDRN) mainly consisting of an opinion entity extraction unit, a relation detection unit, and a synchronization unit. The opinion entity extraction unit and the relation detection unit are developed as two channels to extract opinion entities and relations simultaneously.

Related studies generally extract aspects and/or opinion expressions without recognizing the relations between them. However, the relations are crucial for downstream tasks, including sentiment classification, opinion summarization, etc. In this paper, we explore Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) task, which aims at extracting aspects and opinion expressions in pairs. To deal with this task, we propose Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent Network (SDRN) mainly consisting of an opinion entity extraction unit, a relation detection unit, and a synchronization unit. The opinion entity extraction unit and the relation detection unit are developed as two channels to extract opinion entities and relations simultaneously.

Information Extraction,Continual Relation Learning via Episodic Memory Activation and Reconsolidation,"Continual relation learning aims to continually train a model on new data to learn incessantly emerging novel relations while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old relations. Some pioneering work has proved that storing a handful of historical relation examples in episodic memory and replaying them in subsequent training is an effective solution for such a challenging problem. However, these memorybased methods usually suffer from overfitting the few memorized examples of old relations, which may gradually cause inevitable confusion among existing relations. Inspired by the mechanism in human long-term memory formation, we introduce episodic memory activation and reconsolidation (EMAR) to continual relation learning. Every time neural models are activated to learn both new and memorized data, EMAR utilizes relation prototypes for memory reconsolidation exercise to keep a stable understanding of old relations. The experimental results show that EMAR could get rid of catastrophically forgetting old relations and outperform the state-of-the-art continual learning models.

Information Extraction,"Amalgamation of protein sequence, structure and textual information for improving protein-protein interaction identification","An in-depth exploration of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is essential to understand the metabolism in addition to the regulations of biological entities like proteins, carbohydrates, and many more. Most of the recent PPI tasks in BioNLP domain have been carried out solely using textual data. In this paper, we argue that incorporation of multimodal cues can improve the automatic identification of PPI. As a first step towards enabling the development of multimodal approaches for PPI identification, we have developed two multimodal datasets which are extensions and multimodal versions of two popular benchmark PPI corpora (BioInfer and HRPD50). Besides, existing textual modalities, two new modalities, 3D protein structure and underlying genomic sequence, are also added to each instance. Further, a novel deep multi-modal architecture is also implemented to efficiently predict the protein interactions from the developed datasets. A detailed experimental analysis reveals the superiority of the multi-modal approach in comparison to the strong baselines including uni-modal approaches and state-of the-art methods over both the generated multimodal datasets.

Information Extraction,TACRED Revisited: A Thorough Evaluation of the TACRED Relation Extraction Task,"TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017)  is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE). But, even with recent advances in unsupervised pretraining and knowledge enhanced neural RE, models still show a high error rate. In this paper, we investigate the questions: Have we reached a performance ceiling or is there still room for improvement? And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models. We show that two groups of ambiguous relations are responsible for most of the remaining errors and that models may adopt shallow heuristics on the dataset when entities are not masked.","{'sequence': 'TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017)  is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE).

We propose a simple yet effective method, FGS2EE, to inject fine-grained semantic information into entity embeddings to reduce the distinctiveness and facilitate the learning of contextual commonality.

Information Extraction,NAT: Noise-Aware Training for Robust Neural Sequence Labeling,"Sequence labeling systems should perform reliably not only under ideal conditions but also with corrupted inputs-as these systems often process user-generated text or follow an errorprone upstream component. To this end, we formulate the noisy sequence labeling problem, where the input may undergo an unknown noising process and propose two Noise-Aware Training (NAT) objectives that improve robustness of sequence labeling performed on perturbed input: Our data augmentation method trains a neural model using a mixture of clean and noisy samples, whereas our stability training algorithm encourages the model to create a noise-invariant latent representation. We employ a vanilla noise model at training time. For evaluation, we use both the original data and its variants perturbed with real OCR errors and misspellings. Extensive experiments on English and German named entity recognition benchmarks confirmed that NAT consistently improved robustness of popular sequence labeling models, preserving accuracy on the original input. We make our code and data publicly available for the research community.","{'sequence': 'Sequence labeling systems should perform reliably not only under ideal conditions but also with corrupted inputs-as these systems often process user-generated text or follow an errorprone upstream component.

Information Extraction,A Two-Stage Masked LM Method for Term Set Expansion,"We tackle the task of Term Set Expansion (TSE): given a small seed set of example terms from a semantic class, finding more members of that class.

Information Extraction,Simplify the Usage of Lexicon in Chinese NER,"Recently, many works have tried to augment the performance of Chinese named entity recognition (NER) using word lexicons. As a representative, Lattice-LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018) has achieved new benchmark results on several public Chinese NER datasets. However, Lattice-LSTM has a complex model architecture. This limits its application in many industrial areas where real-time NER responses are needed. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method for incorporating the word lexicon into the character representations. This method avoids designing a complicated sequence modeling architecture, and for any neural NER model, it requires only subtle adjustment of the character representation layer to introduce the lexicon information. Experimental studies on four benchmark Chinese NER datasets show that our method achieves an inference speed up to 6.15 times faster than those of state-ofthe-art methods, along with a better performance. The experimental results also show that the proposed method can be easily incorporated with pre-trained models like BERT. 1","{'sequence': 'Recently, many works have tried to augment the performance of Chinese named entity recognition (NER) using word lexicons. As a representative, Lattice-LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018) has achieved new benchmark results on several public Chinese NER datasets. However, Lattice-LSTM has a complex model architecture. This limits its application in many industrial areas where real-time NER responses are needed.

Information Extraction,Rationalizing Medical Relation Prediction from Corpus-level Statistics,"Nowadays, the interpretability of machine learning models is becoming increasingly important, especially in the medical domain. Aiming to shed some light on how to rationalize medical relation prediction, we present a new interpretable framework inspired by existing theories on how human memory works, e.g., theories of recall and recognition. Given the corpus-level statistics, i.e., a global cooccurrence graph of a clinical text corpus, to predict the relations between two entities, we first recall rich contexts associated with the target entities, and then recognize relational interactions between these contexts to form model rationales, which will contribute to the final prediction. We conduct experiments on a real-world public clinical dataset and show that our framework can not only achieve competitive predictive performance against a comprehensive list of neural baseline models, but also present rationales to justify its prediction. We further collaborate with medical experts deeply to verify the usefulness of our model rationales for clinical decision making 1 .","{'sequence': 'Nowadays, the interpretability of machine learning models is becoming increasingly important, especially in the medical domain.

Information Extraction,A Two-Step Approach for Implicit Event Argument Detection,"In this work, we explore the implicit event argument detection task, which studies event arguments beyond sentence boundaries. The addition of cross-sentence argument candidates imposes great challenges for modeling. To reduce the number of candidates, we adopt a two-step approach, decomposing the problem into two sub-problems: argument head-word detection and head-to-span expansion. Evaluated on the recent RAMS dataset (Ebner et al., 2020), our model achieves overall better performance than a strong sequence labeling baseline. We further provide detailed error analysis, presenting where the model mainly makes errors and indicating directions for future improvements.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Contextualized Weak Supervision for Text Classification,"Weakly supervised text classification based on a few user-provided seed words has recently attracted much attention from researchers. Existing methods mainly generate pseudo-labels in a context-free manner (e.g., string matching), therefore, the ambiguous, context-dependent nature of human language has been long overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ConWea, providing contextualized weak supervision for text classification. Specifically, we leverage contextualized representations of word occurrences and seed word information to automatically differentiate multiple interpretations of the same word, and thus create a contextualized corpus. This contextualized corpus is further utilized to train the classifier and expand seed words in an iterative manner. This process not only adds new contextualized, highly label-indicative keywords but also disambiguates initial seed words, making our weak supervision fully contextualized. Extensive experiments and case studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the necessity and significant advantages of using contextualized weak supervision, especially when the class labels are fine-grained.","{'sequence': 'Weakly supervised text classification based on a few user-provided seed words has recently attracted much attention from researchers.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Hierarchy-Aware Global Model for Hierarchical Text Classification,"Hierarchical text classification is an essential yet challenging subtask of multi-label text classification with a taxonomic hierarchy.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Empower Entity Set Expansion via Language Model Probing,"Entity set expansion, aiming at expanding a small seed entity set with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, is a critical task that benefits many downstream NLP and IR applications, such as question answering, query understanding, and taxonomy construction. Existing set expansion methods bootstrap the seed entity set by adaptively selecting context features and extracting new entities. A key challenge for entity set expansion is to avoid selecting ambiguous context features which will shift the class semantics and lead to accumulative errors in later iterations. In this study, we propose a novel iterative set expansion framework that leverages automatically generated class names to address the semantic drift issue. In each iteration, we select one positive and several negative class names by probing a pre-trained language model, and further score each candidate entity based on selected class names. Experiments on two datasets show that our framework generates high-quality class names and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.","{'sequence': 'Entity set expansion, aiming at expanding a small seed entity set with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, is a critical task that benefits many downstream NLP and IR applications, such as question answering, query understanding, and taxonomy construction.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Learning Robust Models for e-Commerce Product Search,"Showing items that do not match search query intent degrades customer experience in ecommerce. These mismatches result from counterfactual biases of the ranking algorithms toward noisy behavioral signals such as clicks and purchases in the search logs.

In this paper, we develop a deep, endto-end model that learns to effectively classify mismatches and to generate hard mismatched examples to improve the classifier. We train the model end-to-end by introducing a latent variable into the cross-entropy loss that alternates between using the real and generated samples. This not only makes the classifier more robust but also boosts the overall ranking performance.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Generative Semantic Hashing Enhanced via Boltzmann Machines,"Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training, existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution, enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size, independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper, to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes, we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training, we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that, an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques, the entire model can be optimized efficiently.

Finally, the word nodes are incorporated as the document embedding. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-theart text classification methods.', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'System Demonstrations', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Theme', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.1437574177980423, 0.12992975115776062, 0.0627443715929985, 0.054362744092941284, 0.048991259187459946, 0.046478647738695145, 0.04456155002117157, 0.042193442583084106, 0.03941630199551582, 0.03749234974384308, 0.03249073028564453, 0.03048836998641491, 0.028865996748209, 0.028651224449276924, 0.02838153764605522, 0.024680988863110542, 0.02423013374209404, 0.022908087819814682, 0.02182028256356716, 0.021389933302998543, 0.020068109035491943, 0.019045567139983177, 0.018716463819146156, 0.01502266339957714, 0.008863388560712337, 0.004448668099939823]}",0.1437574177980423,Machine Learning for NLP,0.019045567139983177

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Feature Projection for Improved Text Classification,"In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels. For example, in sentiment classification, words like good and nice are indicative of the positive sentiment and words like bad and terrible are indicative of the negative sentiment. However, there are also many common features (e.g., words) that are not indicative of any specific class (e.g., voice and screen, which are common to both sentiment classes and are not discriminative for classification). Although deep learning has made significant progresses in generating discriminative features through its powerful representation learning, we believe there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel angle to further improve this representation learning, i.e., feature projection. This method projects existing features into the orthogonal space of the common features. The resulting projection is thus perpendicular to the common features and more discriminative for classification. We apply this new method to improve CNN, RNN, Transformer, and Bert based text classification and obtain markedly better results.","{'sequence': 'In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Exclusive Hierarchical Decoding for Deep Keyphrase Generation,"Keyphrase generation (KG) aims to summarize the main ideas of a document into a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce. Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover, previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of previouslypredicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity of the generated keyphrases.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Neural Topic Modeling with Bidirectional Adversarial Training,"Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a twoway projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6% is observed in accuracy.","{'sequence': 'Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a twoway projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,CluHTM - Semantic Hierarchical Topic Modeling based on CluWords,"Hierarchical Topic modeling (HTM) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration. Despite advantages over traditional topic modeling, HTM poses its own challenges, such as (1) topic incoherence, (2) unreasonable (hierarchical) structure, and (3) issues related to the definition of the ""ideal"" number of topics and depth of the hierarchy. In this paper, we advance the stateof-the-art on HTM by means of the design and evaluation of CluHTM, a novel nonprobabilistic hierarchical matrix factorization aimed at solving the specific issues of HTM. CluHTM's novel contributions include: (i) the exploration of richer text representation that encapsulates both, global (dataset level) and local semantic information -when combined, these pieces of information help to solve the topic incoherence problem as well as issues related to the unreasonable structure; (ii) the exploitation of a stability analysis metric for defining the number of topics and the ""shape"" the hierarchical structure. In our evaluation, considering twelve datasets and seven stateof-the-art baselines, CluHTM outperformed the baselines in the vast majority of the cases, with gains of around 500% over the strongest state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses of why our solution works so well.","{'sequence': 'Hierarchical Topic modeling (HTM) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration.

A model is simulatable when a person can predict its behavior on new inputs. Through two kinds of simulation tests involving text and tabular data, we evaluate five explanations methods: (1) LIME, (2) Anchor, (3) Decision Boundary, (4) a Prototype model, and (5) a Composite approach that combines explanations from each method. Clear evidence of method effectiveness is found in very few cases: LIME improves simulatability in tabular classification, and our Prototype method is effective in counterfactual simulation tests. We also collect subjective ratings of explanations, but we do not find that ratings are predictive of how helpful explanations are. Our results provide the first reliable and comprehensive estimates of how explanations influence simulatability across a variety of explanation methods and data domains.

We show that (1) we need to be careful about the metrics we use to evaluate explanation methods, and (2) there is significant room for improvement in current methods. 1', 'labels': ['Student Research Workshop', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theme', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'System Demonstrations', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.0805773138999939, 0.06692660599946976, 0.06470073759555817, 0.05823682248592377, 0.05547799915075302, 0.05325677990913391, 0.04539365693926811, 0.045142486691474915, 0.042706381529569626, 0.04251687973737717, 0.039528440684080124, 0.0371989943087101, 0.03428783267736435, 0.03425837308168411, 0.033073268830776215, 0.032636433839797974, 0.030693134292960167, 0.028872473165392876, 0.026767566800117493, 0.026679182425141335, 0.024622583761811256, 0.022693799808621407, 0.020596347749233246, 0.019418220967054367, 0.018713781610131264, 0.015023884363472462]}",0.0805773138999939,Student Research Workshop,0.022693799808621407
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,How does BERT's attention change when you fine-tune? An analysis methodology and a case study in negation scope,"Large pretrained language models like BERT, after fine-tuning to a downstream task, have achieved high performance on a variety of NLP problems. Yet explaining their decisions is difficult despite recent work probing their internal representations. We propose a procedure and analysis methods that take a hypothesis of how a transformer-based model might encode a linguistic phenomenon, and test the validity of that hypothesis based on a comparison between knowledge-related downstream tasks with downstream control tasks, and measurement of cross-dataset consistency. We apply this methodology to test BERT and RoBERTa on a hypothesis that some attention heads will consistently attend from a word in negation scope to the negation cue. We find that after fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa on a negation scope task, the average attention head improves its sensitivity to negation and its attention consistency across negation datasets compared to the pre-trained models. However, only the base models (not the large models) improve compared to a control task, indicating there is evidence for a shallow encoding of negation only in the base models.","{'sequence': 'Large pretrained language models like BERT, after fine-tuning to a downstream task, have achieved high performance on a variety of NLP problems.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An Analysis of the Utility of Explicit Negative Examples to Improve the Syntactic Abilities of Neural Language Models,"We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models. Negative examples here are incorrect words in a sentence, such as barks in *The dogs barks. Neural language models are commonly trained only on positive examples, a set of sentences in the training data, but recent studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In this paper, we first demonstrate that appropriately using negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement) will boost the model's robustness on them in English, with a negligible loss of perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level of subjectrelative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions.","{'sequence': ""We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,ERASER: A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models,"State-of-the-art models in NLP are now predominantly based on deep neural networks that are opaque in terms of how they come to make predictions.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Compositionality and Generalization In Emergent Languages,"Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality. In this paper, we study whether the language emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents. We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive.","{'sequence': 'Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality.

We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Student Research Workshop', 'System Demonstrations', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Generation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Summarization', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.08683294802904129, 0.06998839974403381, 0.05568327009677887, 0.055667415261268616, 0.05552857369184494, 0.05178837105631828, 0.04560546576976776, 0.04024934768676758, 0.03875648230314255, 0.03776788339018822, 0.037541713565588, 0.035312920808792114, 0.03377388417720795, 0.03361179307103157, 0.03337930887937546, 0.033340323716402054, 0.031040502712130547, 0.030520591884851456, 0.027856631204485893, 0.02691028267145157, 0.026525426656007767, 0.024239854887127876, 0.023346789181232452, 0.02297503501176834, 0.022739743813872337, 0.019017167389392853]}",0.08683294802904129,Question Answering,0.05178837105631828
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models,"This paper investigates contextual word representation models from the lens of similarity analysis. Given a collection of trained models, we measure the similarity of their internal representations and attention. Critically, these models come from vastly different architectures. We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. 1 * Equal contribution 1 The code is available at https://github.com/ johnmwu/contextual-corr-analysis.","{'sequence': 'This paper investigates contextual word representation models from the lens of similarity analysis.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Generating Hierarchical Explanations on Text Classification via Feature Interaction Detection,"Generating explanations for neural networks has become crucial for their applications in real-world with respect to reliability and trustworthiness. In natural language processing, existing methods usually provide important features which are words or phrases selected from an input text as an explanation, but ignore the interactions between them.

Such explanations visualize how words and phrases are combined at different levels of the hierarchy, which can help users understand the decision-making of blackbox models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Analyzing analytical methods: The case of phonology in neural models of spoken language,"Given the fast development of analysis techniques for NLP and speech processing systems, few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method. As a step in this direction we study the case of representations of phonology in neural network models of spoken language. We use two commonly applied analytical techniques, diagnostic classifiers and representational similarity analysis, to quantify to what extent neural activation patterns encode phonemes and phoneme sequences. We manipulate two factors that can affect the outcome of analysis. First, we investigate the role of learning by comparing neural activations extracted from trained versus randomly-initialized models. Second, we examine the temporal scope of the activations by probing both local activations corresponding to a few milliseconds of the speech signal, and global activations pooled over the whole utterance. We conclude that reporting analysis results with randomly initialized models is crucial, and that global-scope methods tend to yield more consistent results and we recommend their use as a complement to local-scope diagnostic methods.","{'sequence': 'Given the fast development of analysis techniques for NLP and speech processing systems, few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Towards Transparent and Explainable Attention Models,"Recent studies on interpretability of attention distributions have led to notions of faithful and plausible explanations for a model's predictions. Attention distributions can be considered a faithful explanation if a higher attention weight implies a greater impact on the model's prediction. They can be considered a plausible explanation if they provide a humanunderstandable justification for the model's predictions. In this work, we first explain why current attention mechanisms in LSTM based encoders can neither provide a faithful nor a plausible explanation of the model's predictions. We observe that in LSTM based encoders the hidden representations at different time-steps are very similar to each other (high conicity) and attention weights in these situations do not carry much meaning because even a random permutation of the attention weights does not affect the model's predictions. Based on experiments on a wide variety of tasks and datasets, we observe attention distributions often attribute the model's predictions to unimportant words such as punctuation and fail to offer a plausible explanation for the predictions. To make attention mechanisms more faithful and plausible, we propose a modified LSTM cell with a diversity-driven training objective that ensures that the hidden representations learned at different time steps are diverse. We show that the resulting attention distributions offer more transparency as they (i) provide a more precise importance ranking of the hidden states (ii) are better indicative of words important for the model's predictions (iii) correlate better with gradient-based attribution methods. Human evaluations indicate that the attention distributions learned by our model offer a plausible explanation of the model's predictions.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Perturbed Masking: Parameter-free Probing for Analyzing and Interpreting BERT,"By introducing a small set of additional parameters, a probe learns to solve specific linguistic tasks (e.g., dependency parsing) in a supervised manner using feature representations (e.g., contextualized embeddings). The effectiveness of such probing tasks is taken as evidence that the pre-trained model encodes linguistic knowledge. However, this approach of evaluating a language model is undermined by the uncertainty of the amount of knowledge that is learned by the probe itself. Complementary to those works, we propose a parameter-free probing technique for analyzing pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT). Our method does not require direct supervision from the probing tasks, nor do we introduce additional parameters to the probing process.

The effectiveness of such probing tasks is taken as evidence that the pre-trained model encodes linguistic knowledge. However, this approach of evaluating a language model is undermined by the uncertainty of the amount of knowledge that is learned by the probe itself. Complementary to those works, we propose a parameter-free probing technique for analyzing pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT).

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Rationalizing Text Matching: Learning Sparse Alignments via Optimal Transport,"Selecting input features of top relevance has become a popular method for building selfexplaining models. In this work, we extend this selective rationalization approach to text matching, where the goal is to jointly select and align text pieces, such as tokens or sentences, as a justification for the downstream prediction. Our approach employs optimal transport (OT) to find a minimal cost alignment between the inputs. However, directly applying OT often produces dense and therefore uninterpretable alignments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce novel constrained variants of the OT problem that result in highly sparse alignments with controllable sparsity. Our model is end-to-end differentiable using the Sinkhorn algorithm for OT and can be trained without any alignment annotations. We evaluate our model on the Stack-Exchange, MultiNews, e-SNLI, and MultiRC datasets. Our model achieves very sparse rationale selections with high fidelity while preserving prediction accuracy compared to strong attention baseline models. † * Denotes equal contribution.","{'sequence': 'Selecting input features of top relevance has become a popular method for building selfexplaining models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Interpreting Pretrained Contextualized Representations via Reductions to Static Embeddings,"Contextualized representations (e.g. ELMo, BERT) have become the default pretrained representations for downstream NLP applications.

Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models that share the same training data.

In NLP this often entails extracting snippets of an input text 'responsible for' corresponding model output; when such a snippet comprises tokens that indeed informed the model's prediction, it is a faithful explanation. In some settings, faithfulness may be critical to ensure transparency. Lei et al. (2016) proposed a model to produce faithful rationales for neural text classification by defining independent snippet extraction and prediction modules. However, the discrete selection over input tokens performed by this method complicates training, leading to high variance and requiring careful hyperparameter tuning. We propose a simpler variant of this approach that provides faithful explanations by construction. In our scheme, named FRESH, arbitrary feature importance scores (e.g., gradients from a trained model) are used to induce binary labels over token inputs, which an extractor can be trained to predict. An independent classifier module is then trained exclusively on snippets provided by the extractor; these snippets thus constitute faithful explanations, even if the classifier is arbitrarily complex. In both automatic and manual evaluations we find that variants of this simple framework yield predictive performance superior to 'end-to-end' approaches, while being more general and easier to train. 1","{'sequence': ""In many settings it is important for one to be able to understand why a model made a particular prediction.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,"The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much these networks actually ""know"" about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines.

To remedy that, we train the model with auxiliary supervision and propose particular choices for module architecture that yield much better faithfulness, at a minimal cost to accuracy."", 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Theme', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.11233159154653549, 0.07379686087369919, 0.07236920297145844, 0.05926867946982384, 0.05330253019928932, 0.04738541692495346, 0.044778648763895035, 0.04340206831693649, 0.038991574198007584, 0.03847428411245346, 0.03679458051919937, 0.035584431141614914, 0.03470891714096069, 0.03334338963031769, 0.027632318437099457, 0.027508938685059547, 0.02729489468038082, 0.02646963857114315, 0.025902802124619484, 0.02295161969959736, 0.022559667006134987, 0.022150760516524315, 0.02115340158343315, 0.020621882751584053, 0.018445873633027077, 0.012775968760251999]}",0.11233159154653549,Resources and Evaluation,0.03334338963031769
Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Influence Paths for Characterizing Subject-Verb Number Agreement in LSTM Language Models,"LSTM-based recurrent neural networks are the state-of-the-art for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their performance, it is unclear whether, or how, LSTMs learn structural features of natural languages such as subject-verb number agreement in English. Lacking this understanding, the generality of LSTMs on this task and their suitability for related tasks remains uncertain. Further, errors cannot be properly attributed to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other exceptional faults. We introduce influence paths, a causal account of structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the subsequent verb) into a set of gate-level or neuron-level paths. The set localizes and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g., attractors). We exemplify the methodology on a widely-studied multi-layer LSTM language model, demonstrating its accounting for subject-verb number agreement. The results offer both a finer and a more complete view of an LSTM's handling of this structural aspect of the English language than prior results based on diagnostic classifiers and ablation.","{'sequence': ""LSTM-based recurrent neural networks are the state-of-the-art for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,What BERT Is Not: Lessons from a New Suite of Psycholinguistic Diagnostics for Language Models,"Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models. In this paper we introduce a suite of diagnostics drawn from human language experiments, which allow us to ask targeted questions about information used by language models for generating predictions in context. As a case study, we apply these diagnostics to the popular BERT model, finding that it can generally distinguish good from bad completions involving shared category or role reversal, albeit with less sensitivity than humans, and it robustly retrieves noun hypernyms, but it struggles with challenging inference and role-based event predictionand, in particular, it shows clear insensitivity to the contextual impacts of negation.","{'sequence': 'Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Explaining Black Box Predictions and Unveiling Data Artifacts through Influence Functions,"Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously opaque. This has motivated the development of methods for interpreting such models, e.g., via gradient-based saliency maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular model prediction by highlighting important words in the corresponding input text. While this might be useful for tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by individual tokens in the input, we suspect that such highlighting is not always suitable for tasks where model decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate the use of influence functions for NLP, providing an alternative approach to interpreting neural text classifiers. Influence functions explain the decisions of a model by identifying influential training examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence functions have not yet been extensively evaluated in the context of NLP, a gap addressed by this work. We conduct a comparison between influence functions and common word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As suspected, we find that influence functions are particularly useful for natural language inference, a task in which 'saliency maps' may not provide clear interpretation.

To achieve this, we design and conduct a large-scale crowd-sourcing study to collect human attention maps that encode the parts of a text that humans focus on when conducting text classification. Based on this new resource of human attention dataset for text classification, YELP-HAT, collected on the publicly available YELP dataset, we perform a quantitative comparative analysis of machine attention maps created by deep learning models and human attention maps. Our analysis offers insights into the relationships between human versus machine attention maps along three dimensions: overlap in word selections, distribution over lexical categories, and context-dependency of sentiment polarity.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Probing for Referential Information in Language Models,"Language models keep track of complex linguistic information about the preceding context -including, e.g., syntactic relations in a sentence. We investigate whether they also capture information beneficial for resolving pronominal anaphora in English. We analyze two state of the art models with LSTM and Transformer architectures, respectively, using probe tasks on a coreference annotated corpus. Our hypothesis is that language models will capture grammatical properties of anaphora (such as agreement between a pronoun and its antecedent), but not semantico-referential information (the fact that pronoun and antecedent refer to the same entity). Instead, we find evidence that models capture referential aspects to some extent -though they are still much better at grammar. The Transformer outperforms the LSTM in all analyses, and exhibits in particular better semantico-referential abilities.","{'sequence': 'Language models keep track of complex linguistic information about the preceding context -including, e.g., syntactic relations in a sentence.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Understanding Attention for Text Classification,"Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, many researchers started to investigate the interpretability of attention on NLP tasks. Many existing approaches focused on examining whether the local attention weights could reflect the importance of input representations. In this work, we present a study on understanding the internal mechanism of attention by looking into the gradient update process, checking its behavior when approaching a local minimum during training. We propose to analyze for each word token the following two quantities: its polarity score and its attention score, where the latter is a global assessment on the token's significance. We discuss conditions under which the attention mechanism may become more (or less) interpretable, and show how the interplay between the two quantities may impact the model performance. 1","{'sequence': ""Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Cross-media Structured Common Space for Multimedia Event Extraction,"We introduce a new task, MultiMedia Event Extraction (M 2 E 2 ), which aims to extract events and their arguments from multimedia documents. We develop the first benchmark and collect a dataset of 245 multimedia news articles with extensively annotated events and arguments. 1 We propose a novel method, Weakly Aligned Structured Embedding (WASE), that encodes structured representations of semantic information from textual and visual data into a common embedding space. The structures are aligned across modalities by employing a weakly supervised training strategy, which enables exploiting available resources without explicit cross-media annotation.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Learning Web-based Procedures by Reasoning over Explanations and Demonstrations in Context,"We explore learning web-based tasks from a human teacher through natural language explanations and a single demonstration. Our approach investigates a new direction for semantic parsing that models explaining a demonstration in a context, rather than mapping explanations to demonstrations. By leveraging the idea of inverse semantics from program synthesis to reason backwards from observed demonstrations, we ensure that all considered interpretations are consistent with executable actions in any context, thus simplifying the problem of search over logical forms. We present a dataset of explanations paired with demonstrations for web-based tasks. Our methods show better task completion rates than a supervised semantic parsing baseline (40% relative improvement on average), and are competitive with simple exploration-anddemonstration based methods, while requiring no exploration of the environment.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",MART: Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer for Coherent Video Paragraph Captioning,"Generating multi-sentence descriptions for videos is one of the most challenging captioning tasks due to its high requirements for not only visual relevance but also discoursebased coherence across the sentences in the paragraph. Towards this goal, we propose a new approach called Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer (MART), which uses a memory module to augment the transformer architecture. The memory module generates a highly summarized memory state from the video segments and the sentence history so as to help better prediction of the next sentence (w.r.t. coreference and repetition aspects), thus encouraging coherent paragraph generation. Extensive experiments, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses on two popular datasets ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII show that MART generates more coherent and less repetitive paragraph captions than baseline methods, while maintaining relevance to the input video events. 1 * Work done while Jie Lei was an intern and Yelong Shen was an employee at Tencent AI Lab.","{'sequence': 'Generating multi-sentence descriptions for videos is one of the most challenging captioning tasks due to its high requirements for not only visual relevance but also discoursebased coherence across the sentences in the paragraph.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",BabyWalk: Going Farther in Vision-and-Language Navigation by Taking Baby Steps,"Learning to follow instructions is of fundamental importance to autonomous agents for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). In this paper, we study how an agent can navigate long paths when learning from a corpus that consists of shorter ones. We show that existing state-of-the-art agents do not generalize well. To this end, we propose BabyWalk, a new VLN agent that is learned to navigate by decomposing long instructions into shorter ones (BabySteps) and completing them sequentially. A special design memory buffer is used by the agent to turn its past experiences into contexts for future steps. The learning process is composed of two phases. In the first phase, the agent uses imitation learning from demonstration to accomplish BabySteps. In the second phase, the agent uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning to maximize rewards on navigation tasks with increasingly longer instructions. We create two new benchmark datasets (of long navigation tasks) and use them in conjunction with existing ones to examine BabyWalk's generalization ability. Empirical results show that BabyWalk achieves state-of-the-art results on several metrics, in particular, is able to follow long instructions better.

To that end, we propose a challenging subset (VisDialConv) of the VisDial val set and provide a benchmark of 63% NDCG.', 'labels': ['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Theme', 'System Demonstrations', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09687193483114243, 0.09474121034145355, 0.08930157124996185, 0.0761488825082779, 0.056690748780965805, 0.05668020620942116, 0.05424562096595764, 0.04042088985443115, 0.037910230457782745, 0.037025563418865204, 0.035847168415784836, 0.03166684880852699, 0.029300177469849586, 0.027900608256459236, 0.026890501379966736, 0.026571378111839294, 0.024655364453792572, 0.02458355389535427, 0.022016281262040138, 0.0212458036839962, 0.01951599307358265, 0.017534438520669937, 0.01593896932899952, 0.015753936022520065, 0.012835546396672726, 0.007706576492637396]}",0.09687193483114243,Dialogue and Interactive Systems,0.01951599307358265
"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Dense-Caption Matching and Frame-Selection Gating for Temporal Localization in VideoQA,"Videos convey rich information. Dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between people/objects, and diverse multimodal events are present in a video clip. Hence, it is important to develop automated models that can accurately extract such information from videos. Answering questions on videos is one of the tasks which can evaluate such AI abilities. In this paper, we propose a video question answering model which effectively integrates multi-modal input sources and finds the temporally relevant information to answer questions. Specifically, we first employ dense image captions to help identify objects and their detailed salient regions and actions, and hence give the model useful extra information (in explicit textual format to allow easier matching) for answering questions. Moreover, our model is also comprised of duallevel attention (word/object and frame level), multi-head self/cross-integration for different sources (video and dense captions), and gates which pass more relevant information to the classifier. Finally, we also cast the frame selection problem as a multi-label classification task and introduce two loss functions, In-and-Out Frame Score Margin (IOFSM) and Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (BBCE), to better supervise the model with human importance annotations. We evaluate our model on the challenging TVQA dataset, where each of our model components provides significant gains, and our overall model outperforms the stateof-the-art by a large margin (74.09% versus 70.52%). We also present several word, object, and frame level visualization studies. 1","{'sequence': 'Videos convey rich information.

In particular, our schuBERT gives 6.6% higher average accuracy on GLUE and SQuAD datasets as compared to BERT with three encoder layers while having the same number of parameters.', 'labels': ['Machine Learning for NLP', 'System Demonstrations', 'Theme', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Summarization', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.11596465110778809, 0.09414074569940567, 0.08784674853086472, 0.07970687747001648, 0.07015538215637207, 0.0609552301466465, 0.05266127362847328, 0.044078052043914795, 0.03386786952614784, 0.033730149269104004, 0.033551156520843506, 0.03283512964844704, 0.03197035193443298, 0.026448683813214302, 0.023085933178663254, 0.022617490962147713, 0.022091016173362732, 0.021089354529976845, 0.019494283944368362, 0.01818830333650112, 0.015338928438723087, 0.015037872828543186, 0.014780605211853981, 0.012207891792058945, 0.010859593749046326, 0.007296365220099688]}",0.11596465110778809,Machine Learning for NLP,0.11596465110778809
Machine Learning for NLP,Pre-training Is (Almost) All You Need: An Application to Commonsense Reasoning,"Fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models has become the standard approach for solving common NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) . Most of the existing approaches rely on a randomly initialized classifier on top of such networks. We argue that this fine-tuning procedure is sub-optimal as the pre-trained model has no prior on the specific classifier labels, while it might have already learned an intrinsic textual representation of the task. In this paper, we introduce a new scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training phase. We study commonsense reasoning tasks where the model must rank a set of hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA (Gordon et al., 2012) , Swag (Zellers et al., 2018), HellaSwag  (Zellers et al., 2019)  and CommonsenseQA  (Talmor et al., 2019)  datasets. By exploiting our scoring method without fine-tuning, we are able to produce strong baselines (e.g. 80% test accuracy on COPA) that are comparable to supervised approaches. Moreover, when fine-tuning directly on the proposed scoring function, we show that our method provides a much more stable training phase across random restarts (e.g ×10 standard deviation reduction on COPA test accuracy) and requires less annotated data than the standard classifier approach to reach equivalent performances.","{'sequence': 'Fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models has become the standard approach for solving common NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) .

Machine Learning for NLP,A Mixture of h - 1 Heads is Better than h Heads,"Multi-head attentive neural architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Orthogonal Relation Transforms with Graph Context Modeling for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Distance-based knowledge graph embeddings have shown substantial improvement on the knowledge graph link prediction task, from TransE to the latest state-of-the-art RotatE. However, complex relations such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N still remain challenging to predict. In this work, we propose a novel distance-based approach for knowledge graph link prediction. First we extend the RotatE from 2D complex domain to high dimensional space with orthogonal transforms to model relations. The orthogonal transform embedding for relations keeps the capability for modeling symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse and compositional relations while achieves better modeling capacity. Second, the graph context is integrated into distance scoring functions directly. Specifically, graph context is explicitly modeled via two directed context representations. Each node embedding in knowledge graph is augmented with two context representations, which are computed from the neighboring outgoing and incoming nodes/edges respectively. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy on the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases. Our experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two common benchmarks FB15k-237 and WNRR-18, especially on FB15k-237 which has many high in-degree nodes.

Machine Learning for NLP,Generalizing Natural Language Analysis through Span-relation Representations,"Natural language processing covers a wide variety of tasks predicting syntax, semantics, and information content, and usually each type of output is generated with specially designed architectures. In this paper, we provide the simple insight that a great variety of tasks can be represented in a single unified format consisting of labeling spans and relations between spans, thus a single task-independent model can be used across different tasks. We perform extensive experiments to test this insight on 10 disparate tasks spanning dependency parsing (syntax), semantic role labeling (semantics), relation extraction (information content), aspect based sentiment analysis (sentiment), and many others, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized models. We further demonstrate benefits of multi-task learning, and also show that the proposed method makes it easy to analyze differences and similarities in how the model handles different tasks. Finally, we convert these datasets into a unified format to build a benchmark, which provides a holistic testbed for evaluating future models for generalized natural language analysis.","{'sequence': 'Natural language processing covers a wide variety of tasks predicting syntax, semantics, and information content, and usually each type of output is generated with specially designed architectures.

Machine Learning for NLP,Why Overfitting Isn't Always Bad: Retrofitting Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings to Dictionaries,"Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy. We also retrofit to both the training dictionary and a synthetic dictionary induced from CLWE, which sometimes generalizes even better on downstream tasks. Our results confirm the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary in downstream tasks and explains why BLI is a flawed CLWE evaluation.","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI).

Machine Learning for NLP,Learning to Contextually Aggregate Multi-Source Supervision for Sequence Labeling,"Sequence labeling is a fundamental task for a range of natural language processing problems. When used in practice, its performance is largely influenced by the annotation quality and quantity, and meanwhile, obtaining ground truth labels is often costly. In many cases, ground truth labels do not exist, but noisy annotations or annotations from different domains are accessible. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Consensus Network (CONNET) that can be trained on annotations from multiple sources (e.g., crowd annotation, cross-domain data). It learns individual representation for every source and dynamically aggregates source-specific knowledge by a context-aware attention module. Finally, it leads to a model reflecting the agreement (consensus) among multiple sources. We evaluate the proposed framework in two practical settings of multi-source learning: learning with crowd annotations and unsupervised crossdomain model adaptation. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods in both settings.

Machine Learning for NLP,Pretraining with Contrastive Sentence Objectives Improves Discourse Performance of Language Models,"Recent models for unsupervised representation learning of text have employed a number of techniques to improve contextual word representations but have put little focus on discourse-level representations. We propose CONPONO 1 , an inter-sentence objective for pretraining language models that models discourse coherence and the distance between sentences. Given an anchor sentence, our model is trained to predict the text k sentences away using a sampled-softmax objective where the candidates consist of neighboring sentences and sentences randomly sampled from the corpus. On the discourse representation benchmark DiscoEval, our model improves over the previous state-of-the-art by up to 13% and on average 4% absolute across 7 tasks. Our model is the same size as BERT-Base, but outperforms the much larger BERT-Large model and other more recent approaches that incorporate discourse. We also show that CONPONO yields gains of 2%-6% absolute even for tasks that do not explicitly evaluate discourse: textual entailment (RTE), common sense reasoning (COPA) and reading comprehension (ReCoRD).","{'sequence': 'Recent models for unsupervised representation learning of text have employed a number of techniques to improve contextual word representations but have put little focus on discourse-level representations.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Probabilistic Generative Model for Typographical Analysis of Early Modern Printing,"We propose a deep and interpretable probabilistic generative model to analyze glyph shapes in printed Early Modern documents. We focus on clustering extracted glyph images into underlying templates in the presence of multiple confounding sources of variance.

Critically, by introducing an inference network whose input is restricted to the visual residual between the observation and the interpretably-modified template, we are able to control and isolate what the vector-valued latent variable captures.

Machine Learning for NLP,Generalized Entropy Regularization or: There's Nothing Special about Label Smoothing,"Prior work has explored directly regularizing the output distributions of probabilistic models to alleviate peaky (i.e. over-confident) predictions, a common sign of overfitting. This class of techniques, of which label smoothing is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and datasets in language generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a trained model and its performance on language generation tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparse distributions, an undesirable property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place.

Machine Learning for NLP,Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn lowdimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean-and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attentionbased transformations generalize to multiple relations.

KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns.

Machine Learning for NLP,MobileBERT: a Compact Task-Agnostic BERT for Resource-Limited Devices,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However, these models suffer from heavy model sizes and high latency such that they cannot be deployed to resourcelimited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model. Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be generically applied to various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning. Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT LARGE , while equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an invertedbottleneck incorporated BERT LARGE model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is 4.3× smaller and 5.5× faster than BERT BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUE score of 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT BASE ), and 62 ms latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of 90.0/79.2 (1.5/2.1 higher than BERT BASE ).","{'sequence': 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Machine Learning for NLP,Masked Language Model Scoring,"Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) require finetuning for most NLP tasks.

We show that PLLs outperform scores from autoregressive language models like GPT-2 in a variety of tasks. By rescoring ASR and NMT hypotheses, RoBERTa reduces an endto-end LibriSpeech model's WER by 30% relative and adds up to +1.7 BLEU on state-of-theart baselines for low-resource translation pairs, with further gains from domain adaptation. We attribute this success to PLL's unsupervised expression of linguistic acceptability without a left-to-right bias, greatly improving on scores from GPT-2 (+10 points on island effects, NPI licensing in BLiMP). One can finetune MLMs to give scores without masking, enabling computation in a single inference pass.

Machine Learning for NLP,SMART: Robust and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-trained Natural Language Models through Principled Regularized Optimization,"Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we propose a new learning framework for robust and efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained models to attain better generalization performance. The proposed framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the complexity of the model; 2. Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trustregion methods and can prevent aggressive updating. Our experiments show that the proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks including GLUE, SNLI, SciTail and ANLI.

Experiments on text classification and sequence labeling tasks on several datasets demonstrate that our method emulates or outperforms a traditional model ensemble with 1/K-times fewer parameters.', 'labels': ['System Demonstrations', 'Theme', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.16221404075622559, 0.08346255123615265, 0.07354705780744553, 0.06489964574575424, 0.051350370049476624, 0.04712478816509247, 0.04606243968009949, 0.04203357547521591, 0.04023493081331253, 0.03540182486176491, 0.03468921035528183, 0.03453526645898819, 0.03227396309375763, 0.030984342098236084, 0.02604096755385399, 0.025790881365537643, 0.025485169142484665, 0.025099368765950203, 0.023080341517925262, 0.019894137978553772, 0.019010992720723152, 0.013983718119561672, 0.01390447560697794, 0.012027760967612267, 0.01136875245720148, 0.005499452818185091]}",0.16221404075622559,System Demonstrations,0.03453526645898819
Machine Learning for NLP,Posterior Calibrated Training on Sentence Classification Tasks,"Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability. In many settings however, the quality of posterior probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and empirical posterior probabilities. We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization term. Also, PosCal has the advantage that it incrementally tracks needed statistics for the calibration objective during the training process, making efficient use of large training sets 1 .","{'sequence': 'Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability.

Machine Learning for NLP,Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms for Text Representation,"Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models. In conventional pooling methods such as average, max and attentive pooling, text representations are weighted summations of the L 1 or L ∞ norm of input features. However, their pooling norms are always fixed and may not be optimal for learning accurate text representations in different tasks. In addition, in many popular pooling methods such as max and attentive pooling some features may be over-emphasized, while other useful ones are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms (APLN) approach for text representation. Different from existing pooling methods that use a fixed pooling norm, we propose to learn the norm in an end-to-end manner to automatically find the optimal ones for text representation in different tasks. In addition, we propose two methods to ensure the numerical stability of the model training. The first one is scale limiting, which re-scales the input to ensure non-negativity and alleviate the risk of exponential explosion. The second one is re-formulation, which decomposes the exponent operation to avoid computing the realvalued powers of the input and further accelerate the pooling operation. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of attentive pooling.","{'sequence': 'Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models.

Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.","{'sequence': 'Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs.

In this paper, we propose GAN-BERT that extends the fine-tuning of BERT-like architectures with unlabeled data in a generative adversarial setting.

Machine Learning for NLP,SEEK: Segmented Embedding of Knowledge Graphs,"In recent years, knowledge graph embedding becomes a pretty hot research topic of artificial intelligence and plays increasingly vital roles in various downstream applications, such as recommendation and question answering. However, existing methods for knowledge graph embedding can not make a proper trade-off between the model complexity and the model expressiveness, which makes them still far from satisfactory. To mitigate this problem, we propose a lightweight modeling framework that can achieve highly competitive relational expressiveness without increasing the model complexity. Our framework focuses on the design of scoring functions and highlights two critical characteristics: 1) facilitating sufficient feature interactions; 2) preserving both symmetry and antisymmetry properties of relations. It is noteworthy that owing to the general and elegant design of scoring functions, our framework can incorporate many famous existing methods as special cases.

Machine Learning for NLP,SAFER: A Structure-free Approach for Certified Robustness to Adversarial Word Substitutions,"State-of-the-art NLP models can often be fooled by human-unaware transformations such as synonymous word substitution. For security reasons, it is of critical importance to develop models with certified robustness that can provably guarantee that the prediction is can not be altered by any possible synonymous word substitution. In this work, we propose a certified robust method based on a new randomized smoothing technique, which constructs a stochastic ensemble by applying random word substitutions on the input sentences, and leverage the statistical properties of the ensemble to provably certify the robustness. Our method is simple and structure-free in that it only requires the black-box queries of the model outputs, and hence can be applied to any pre-trained models (such as BERT) and any types of models (world-level or subwordlevel). Our method significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods for certified robustness on both IMDB and Amazon text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to achieve certified robustness on large systems such as BERT with practically meaningful certified accuracy.","{'sequence': 'State-of-the-art NLP models can often be fooled by human-unaware transformations such as synonymous word substitution.

Machine Learning for NLP,Calibrating Structured Output Predictors for Natural Language Processing,"We address the problem of calibrating prediction confidence for output entities of interest in natural language processing (NLP) applications. It is important that NLP applications such as named entity recognition and question answering produce calibrated confidence scores for their predictions, especially if the applications are to be deployed in a safetycritical domain such as healthcare. However, the output space of such structured prediction models is often too large to adapt binary or multi-class calibration methods directly. In this study, we propose a general calibration scheme for output entities of interest in neural network based structured prediction models. Our proposed method can be used with any binary class calibration scheme and a neural network model. Additionally, we show that our calibration method can also be used as an uncertainty-aware, entity-specific decoding step to improve the performance of the underlying model at no additional training cost or data requirements. We show that our method outperforms current calibration techniques for named-entity-recognition, part-ofspeech and question answering. We also improve our model's performance from our decoding step across several tasks and benchmark datasets. Our method improves the calibration and model performance on out-ofdomain test scenarios as well.","{'sequence': ""We address the problem of calibrating prediction confidence for output entities of interest in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Relational Memory-based Embedding Model for Triple Classification and Search Personalization,"Knowledge graph embedding methods often suffer from a limitation of memorizing valid triples to predict new ones for triple classification and search personalization problems. To this end, we introduce a novel embedding model, named R-MeN, that explores a relational memory network to encode potential dependencies in relationship triples. R-MeN considers each triple as a sequence of 3 input vectors that recurrently interact with a memory using a transformer self-attention mechanism. Thus R-MeN encodes new information from interactions between the memory and each input vector to return a corresponding vector. Consequently, R-MeN feeds these 3 returned vectors to a convolutional neural network-based decoder to produce a scalar score for the triple. Experimental results show that our proposed R-MeN obtains state-of-theart results on SEARCH17 for the search personalization task, and on WN11 and FB13 for the triple classification task.","{'sequence': 'Knowledge graph embedding methods often suffer from a limitation of memorizing valid triples to predict new ones for triple classification and search personalization problems.

On several text classification tasks, we show that as the number of training examples grow into the millions, the accuracy gap between finetuning BERT-based model and training vanilla LSTM from scratch narrows to within 1%.

Machine Learning for NLP,Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Neural Network-based Dependency Parsing Models with Adversarial Examples,"Despite achieving prominent performance on many important tasks, it has been reported that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previously studies along this line mainly focused on semantic tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering and reading comprehension. In this study, we show that adversarial examples also exist in dependency parsing: we propose two approaches to study where and how parsers make mistakes by searching over perturbations to existing texts at sentence and phrase levels, and design algorithms to construct such examples in both of the black-box and white-box settings. Our experiments with one of state-of-the-art parsers on the English Penn Treebank (PTB) show that up to 77% of input examples admit adversarial perturbations, and we also show that the robustness of parsing models can be improved by crafting high-quality adversaries and including them in the training stage, while suffering little to no performance drop on the clean input data.","{'sequence': 'Despite achieving prominent performance on many important tasks, it has been reported that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Machine Learning for NLP,SenseBERT: Driving Some Sense into BERT,"The ability to learn from large unlabeled corpora has allowed neural language models to advance the frontier in natural language understanding.

Machine Learning for NLP,On Importance Sampling-Based Evaluation of Latent Language Models,"Language models that use additional latent structures (e.g., syntax trees, coreference chains, and knowledge graph links) provide several advantages over traditional language models. However, likelihood-based evaluation of these models is often intractable as it requires marginalizing over the latent space. Existing methods avoid this issue by using importance sampling. Although this approach has asymptotic guarantees, analysis is rarely conducted on the effect of decisions such as sample size, granularity of sample aggregation, and the proposal distribution on the reported estimates. In this paper, we measure the effect these factors have on perplexity estimates for three different latent language models. In addition, we elucidate subtle differences in how importance sampling is applied, which can have substantial effects on the final estimates, as well as provide theoretical results that reinforce the validity of importance sampling for evaluating latent language models.","{'sequence': 'Language models that use additional latent structures (e.g., syntax trees, coreference chains, and knowledge graph links) provide several advantages over traditional language models.

Machine Learning for NLP,The Right Tool for the Job: Matching Model and Instance Complexities,"As NLP models become larger, executing a trained model requires significant computational resources incurring monetary and environmental costs. To better respect a given inference budget, we propose a modification to contextual representation fine-tuning which, during inference, allows for an early (and fast) ""exit"" from neural network calculations for simple instances, and late (and accurate) exit for hard instances. To achieve this, we add classifiers to different layers of BERT and use their calibrated confidence scores to make early exit decisions. We test our proposed modification on five different datasets in two tasks: three text classification datasets and two natural language inference benchmarks. Our method presents a favorable speed/accuracy tradeoff in almost all cases, producing models which are up to five times faster than the state of the art, while preserving their accuracy. Our method also requires almost no additional training resources (in either time or parameters) compared to the baseline BERT model. Finally, our method alleviates the need for costly retraining of multiple models at different levels of efficiency; we allow users to control the inference speed/accuracy tradeoff using a single trained model, by setting a single variable at inference time.

Machine Learning for NLP,Dependency Graph Enhanced Dual-transformer Structure for Aspect-based Sentiment Classification,"Aspect-based sentiment classification is a popular task aimed at identifying the corresponding emotion of a specific aspect. One sentence may contain various sentiments for different aspects. Many sophisticated methods such as attention mechanism and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely employed for handling this challenge. Recently, semantic dependency tree implemented by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is introduced to describe the inner connection between aspects and the associated emotion words. But the improvement is limited due to the noise and instability of dependency trees. To this end, we propose a dependency graph enhanced dual-transformer network (named DGEDT) by jointly considering the flat representations learnt from Transformer and graphbased representations learnt from the corresponding dependency graph in an iterative interaction manner. Specifically, a dualtransformer structure is devised in DGEDT to support mutual reinforcement between the flat representation learning and graph-based representation learning. The idea is to allow the dependency graph to guide the representation learning of the transformer encoder and vice versa. The results on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGEDT outperforms all state-of-the-art alternatives with a large margin.","{'sequence': 'Aspect-based sentiment classification is a popular task aimed at identifying the corresponding emotion of a specific aspect.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Batch Normalized Inference Network Keeps the KL Vanishing Away,"Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is widely used as a generative model to approximate a model's posterior on latent variables by combining the amortized variational inference and deep neural networks. However, when paired with strong autoregressive decoders, VAE often converges to a degenerated local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"". Previous approaches consider the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) individual for each datapoint. We propose to let the KL follow a distribution across the whole dataset, and analyze that it is sufficient to prevent posterior collapse by keeping the expectation of the KL's distribution positive. Then we propose Batch Normalized-VAE (BN-VAE), a simple but effective approach to set a lower bound of the expectation by regularizing the distribution of the approximate posterior's parameters. Without introducing any new model component or modifying the objective, our approach can avoid the posterior collapse effectively and efficiently. We further show that the proposed BN-VAE can be extended to conditional VAE (CVAE).

Machine Learning for NLP,MixText: Linguistically-Informed Interpolation of Hidden Space for Semi-Supervised Text Classification,"This paper presents MixText, a semisupervised learning method for text classification, which uses our newly designed data augmentation method called TMix. TMix creates a large amount of augmented training samples by interpolating text in hidden space. Moreover, we leverage recent advances in data augmentation to guess low-entropy labels for unlabeled data, hence making them as easy to use as labeled data. By mixing labeled, unlabeled and augmented data, MixText significantly outperformed current pre-trained and fined-tuned models and other state-ofthe-art semi-supervised learning methods on several text classification benchmarks. The improvement is especially prominent when supervision is extremely limited.

Machine Learning for NLP,On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond,"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) combine latent variables with amortized variational inference, whose optimization usually converges into a trivial local optimum termed posterior collapse, especially in text modeling. By tracking the optimization dynamics, we observe the encoder-decoder incompatibility that leads to poor parameterizations of the data manifold. We argue that the trivial local optimum may be avoided by improving the encoder and decoder parameterizations since the posterior network is part of a transition map between them. To this end, we propose Coupled-VAE, which couples a VAE model with a deterministic autoencoder with the same structure and improves the encoder and decoder parameterizations via encoder weight sharing and decoder signal matching. We apply the proposed Coupled-VAE approach to various VAE models with different regularization, posterior family, decoder structure, and optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo) show consistently improved results in terms of probability estimation and richness of the latent space.

Interestingly, we find that an amortized variant of Hard EM performs particularly well in the lowest-resource regimes. 1 * Work done as an intern at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.', 'labels': ['Student Research Workshop', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Question Answering', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'System Demonstrations', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Theme', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.11291225254535675, 0.060622382909059525, 0.0513557605445385, 0.04703162983059883, 0.04525648429989815, 0.0439065545797348, 0.04389362037181854, 0.03978101164102554, 0.03785674646496773, 0.03738788515329361, 0.03628823533654213, 0.036215007305145264, 0.03588905557990074, 0.03588291257619858, 0.035202912986278534, 0.035032231360673904, 0.03399471193552017, 0.03383755311369896, 0.03299526870250702, 0.030754979699850082, 0.029312800616025925, 0.0284401997923851, 0.022671302780508995, 0.02262866497039795, 0.0199398435652256, 0.010909969918429852]}",0.11291225254535675,Student Research Workshop,0.035032231360673904
Machine Learning for NLP,Weight Poisoning Attacks on Pretrained Models,"Recently, NLP has seen a surge in the usage of large pre-trained models. Users download weights of models pre-trained on large datasets, then fine-tune the weights on a task of their choice. This raises the question of whether downloading untrusted pre-trained weights can pose a security threat. In this paper, we show that it is possible to construct ""weight poisoning"" attacks where pre-trained weights are injected with vulnerabilities that expose ""backdoors"" after fine-tuning, enabling the attacker to manipulate the model prediction simply by injecting an arbitrary keyword. We show that by applying a regularization method, which we call RIPPLe, and an initialization procedure, which we call Embedding Surgery, such attacks are possible even with limited knowledge of the dataset and finetuning procedure. Our experiments on sentiment classification, toxicity detection, and spam detection show that this attack is widely applicable and poses a serious threat. Finally, we outline practical defenses against such attacks.

Machine Learning for NLP,Improving Transformer Models by Reordering their Sublayers,"Multilayer transformer networks consist of interleaved self-attention and feedforward sublayers. Could ordering the sublayers in a different pattern lead to better performance? We generate randomly ordered transformers and train them with the language modeling objective. We observe that some of these models are able to achieve better performance than the interleaved baseline, and that those successful variants tend to have more self-attention at the bottom and more feedforward sublayers at the top. We propose a new transformer pattern that adheres to this property, the sandwich transformer, and show that it improves perplexity on multiple word-level and character-level language modeling benchmarks, at no cost in parameters, memory, or training time. However, the sandwich reordering pattern does not guarantee performance gains across every task, as we demonstrate on machine translation models. Instead, we suggest that further exploration of task-specific sublayer reorderings is needed in order to unlock additional gains. 1","{'sequence': 'Multilayer transformer networks consist of interleaved self-attention and feedforward sublayers.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamic Programming Encoding for Subword Segmentation in Neural Machine Translation,"This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units. We view the subword segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several WMT datasets including English ↔ (German, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian).","{'sequence': 'This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction,"Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages. Recent methods are mostly based on unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings, the key to which is to find initial solutions of word translations, followed by the learning and refinement of mappings between the embedding spaces of two languages. However, previous methods find initial solutions just based on word-level information, which may be (1) limited and inaccurate, and (2) prone to contain some noise introduced by the insufficiently pre-trained embeddings of some words. To deal with those issues, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based paradigm to induce bilingual lexicons in a coarse-to-fine way. We first build a graph for each language with its vertices representing different words. Then we extract word cliques from the graphs and map the cliques of two languages. Based on that, we induce the initial word translation solution with the central words of the aligned cliques. This coarse-to-fine approach not only leverages clique-level information, which is richer and more accurate, but also effectively reduces the bad effect of the noise in the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we take the initial solution as the seed to learn cross-lingual embeddings, from which we induce bilingual lexicons. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction compared with previous methods.","{'sequence': 'Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages.

We harness this property and propose domain data selection methods based on such models, which require only a small set of in-domain monolingual data.

We evaluate our data selection methods for neural machine translation across five diverse domains, where they outperform an established approach as measured by both BLEU and by precision and recall of sentence selection with respect to an oracle.', 'labels': ['NLP Applications', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'System Demonstrations', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Theme', 'Question Answering', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.13689696788787842, 0.10383111238479614, 0.09260612726211548, 0.09063711017370224, 0.08520712703466415, 0.056702982634305954, 0.04400721564888954, 0.043289873749017715, 0.03998683765530586, 0.03372335806488991, 0.02925211563706398, 0.028103621676564217, 0.022472241893410683, 0.02109355293214321, 0.020960070192813873, 0.019807398319244385, 0.018998153507709503, 0.017691459506750107, 0.01657300814986229, 0.015041053295135498, 0.013534548692405224, 0.013263875618577003, 0.012471094727516174, 0.008222094736993313, 0.008143916726112366, 0.007483056280761957]}",0.13689696788787842,NLP Applications,0.019807398319244385
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Norm-Based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation,"A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with highresource settings. As the NMT architectures become deeper and wider, this issue gets worse and worse. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of training an NMT by introducing a novel norm-based curriculum learning method. We use the norm (aka length or module) of a word embedding as a measure of 1) the difficulty of the sentence, 2) the competence of the model, and 3) the weight of the sentence. The normbased sentence difficulty takes the advantages of both linguistically motivated and modelbased sentence difficulties. It is easy to determine and contains learning-dependent features. The norm-based model competence makes NMT learn the curriculum in a fully automated way, while the norm-based sentence weight further enhances the learning of the vector representation of the NMT. Experimental results for the WMT'14 English-German and WMT'17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in terms of BLEU score (+1.17/+1.56) and training speedup (2.22x/3.33x).","{'sequence': ""A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with highresource settings.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,"On Exposure Bias, Hallucination and Domain Shift in Neural Machine Translation","The standard training algorithm in neural machine translation (NMT) suffers from exposure bias, and alternative algorithms have been proposed to mitigate this. However, the practical impact of exposure bias is under debate. In this paper, we link exposure bias to another well-known problem in NMT, namely the tendency to generate hallucinations under domain shift. In experiments on three datasets with multiple test domains, we show that exposure bias is partially to blame for hallucinations, and that training with Minimum Risk Training, which avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size.

In this paper, we investigate multi-encoder approaches in document-level neural machine translation (NMT). Surprisingly, we find that the context encoder does not only encode the surrounding sentences but also behaves as a noise generator. This makes us rethink the real benefits of multi-encoder in context-aware translation -some of the improvements come from robust training. We compare several methods that introduce noise and/or well-tuned dropout setup into the training of these encoders.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Self-Attention with Cross-Lingual Position Representation,"Position encoding (PE), an essential part of self-attention networks (SANs), is used to preserve the word order information for natural language processing tasks, generating fixed position indices for input sequences. However, in cross-lingual scenarios, e.g., machine translation, the PEs of source and target sentences are modeled independently.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Systematic Study of Inner-Attention-Based Sentence Representations in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Neural machine translation has considerably improved the quality of automatic translations by learning good representations of input sentences. In this article, we explore a multilingual translation model capable of producing fixed-size sentence representations by incorporating an intermediate crosslingual shared layer, which we refer to as attention bridge. This layer exploits the semantics from each language and develops into a language-agnostic meaning representation that can be efficiently used for transfer learning. We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks. Similarly, we show that trainable downstream tasks benefit from multilingual models, whereas additional language signals do not improve performance in non-trainable benchmarks. This is an important insight Submission","{'sequence': 'Neural machine translation has considerably improved the quality of automatic translations by learning good representations of input sentences.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Jointly Masked Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"The masked language model has received remarkable attention due to its effectiveness on various natural language processing tasks. However, few works have adopted this technique in the sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we introduce a jointly masked sequence-to-sequence model and explore its application on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). Specifically, we first empirically study the functionalities of the encoder and the decoder in NAT models, and find that the encoder takes a more important role than the decoder regarding the translation quality. Therefore, we propose to train the encoder more rigorously by masking the encoder input while training. As for the decoder, we propose to train it based on the consecutive masking of the decoder input with an ngram loss function to alleviate the problem of translating duplicate words. The two types of masks are applied to the model jointly at the training stage. We conduct experiments on five benchmark machine translation tasks, and our model can achieve 27.69/32.24 BLEU scores on WMT14 English-German/German-English tasks with 5+ times speed up compared with an autoregressive model.","{'sequence': 'The masked language model has received remarkable attention due to its effectiveness on various natural language processing tasks.

Most existing frameworks, however, have difficulties in balancing between the translation quality and latency, i.e., the decoding policy is usually either too aggressive or too conservative. We propose an opportunistic decoding technique with timely correction ability, which always (over-)generates a certain mount of extra words at each step to keep the audience on track with the latest information. At the same time, it also corrects, in a timely fashion, the mistakes in the former overgenerated words when observing more source context to ensure high translation quality.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Using Context in Neural Machine Translation Training Objectives,"We present Neural Machine Translation (NMT) training using document-level metrics with batch-level documents. Previous sequence-objective approaches to NMT training focus exclusively on sentence-level metrics like sentence BLEU which do not correspond to the desired evaluation metric, typically document BLEU. Meanwhile research into document-level NMT training focuses on data or model architecture rather than training procedure. We find that each of these lines of research has a clear space in it for the other, and propose merging them with a scheme that allows a document-level evaluation metric to be used in the NMT training objective. We first sample pseudo-documents from sentence samples. We then approximate the expected document BLEU gradient with Monte Carlo sampling for use as a cost function in Minimum Risk Training (MRT). This twolevel sampling procedure gives NMT performance gains over sequence MRT and maximum-likelihood training. We demonstrate that training is more robust for document-level metrics than with sequence metrics.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Regularized Context Gates on Transformer for Machine Translation,"Context gates are effective to control the contributions from the source and target contexts in the recurrent neural network (RNN) based neural machine translation (NMT). However, it is challenging to extend them into the advanced Transformer architecture, which is more complicated than RNN. This paper first provides a method to identify source and target contexts and then introduce a gate mechanism to control the source and target contributions in Transformer. In addition, to further reduce the bias problem in the gate mechanism, this paper proposes a regularization method to guide the learning of the gates with supervision automatically generated using pointwise mutual information. Extensive experiments on 4 translation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model obtains an averaged gain of 1.0 BLEU score over a strong Transformer baseline.","{'sequence': 'Context gates are effective to control the contributions from the source and target contexts in the recurrent neural network (RNN) based neural machine translation (NMT).

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Multi-Domain Neural Machine Translation with Word-Level Adaptive Layer-wise Domain Mixing,"Many multi-domain neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve knowledge transfer by enforcing one encoder to learn shared embedding across domains. However, this design lacks adaptation to individual domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-domain NMT model using individual modules for each domain, on which we apply word-level, adaptive and layer-wise domain mixing. We first observe that words in a sentence are often related to multiple domains. Hence, we assume each word has a domain proportion, which indicates its domain preference. Then word representations are obtained by mixing their embedding in individual domains based on their domain proportions. We show this can be achieved by carefully designing multi-head dot-product attention modules for different domains, and eventually taking weighted averages of their parameters by word-level layer-wise domain proportions. Through this, we can achieve effective domain knowledge sharing, and capture fine-grained domain-specific knowledge as well. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing ones in several NMT tasks.","{'sequence': 'Many multi-domain neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve knowledge transfer by enforcing one encoder to learn shared embedding across domains.

We then compare the subtle differences in computation order in considerable detail, and present a parameter initialization method that leverages the Lipschitz constraint on the initialization of Transformer parameters that effectively ensures training convergence.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Evaluating Explanation Methods for Neural Machine Translation,"Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods. Word Alignment Error Rate can be used as such a metric that matches human understanding, however, it can not measure explanation methods on those target words that are not aligned to any source word.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Leveraging Monolingual Data with Self-Supervision for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Over the last few years two promising research directions in low-resource neural machine translation (NMT) have emerged. The first focuses on utilizing high-resource languages to improve the quality of low-resource languages via multilingual NMT. The second direction employs monolingual data with selfsupervision to pre-train translation models, followed by fine-tuning on small amounts of supervised data. In this work, we join these two lines of research and demonstrate the efficacy of monolingual data with self-supervision in multilingual NMT. We offer three major results: (i) Using monolingual data significantly boosts the translation quality of lowresource languages in multilingual models. (ii) Self-supervision improves zero-shot translation quality in multilingual models. (iii) Leveraging monolingual data with self-supervision provides a viable path towards adding new languages to multilingual models, getting up to 33 BLEU on WMT ro-en translation without any parallel data or back-translation.","{'sequence': 'Over the last few years two promising research directions in low-resource neural machine translation (NMT) have emerged.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Linguistic Representational Power of Neural Machine Translation Models,"Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing and other spheres of artificial intelligence, their interpretability remains a challenge. We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word structure captured within the learned representations, which is an important aspect in translating morphologically rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models trained in an end-to-end fashion, without being provided any direct supervision during the training process, learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include the following observations: (i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers of the model; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about word-morphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.","{'sequence': 'Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing and other spheres of artificial intelligence, their interpretability remains a challenge.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing,"Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search.

Then we train a Super-Transformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device).

However, NAT discards the dependency information in a sentence, and thus inevitably suffers from the multi-modality problem: the target tokens may be provided by different possible translations, often causing token repetitions or missing. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel semiautoregressive model RecoverSAT in this work, which generates a translation as a sequence of segments. The segments are generated simultaneously while each segment is predicted token-by-token. By dynamically determining segment length and deleting repetitive segments, RecoverSAT is capable of recovering from repetitive and missing token errors.

Experimental results on three widelyused benchmark datasets show that our proposed model achieves more than 4× speedup while maintaining comparable performance compared with the corresponding autoregressive model. * indicates equal contribution † indicates corresponding author Src. es gibt heute viele Farmer mit diesem Ansatz Feasible there are lots of farmers doing this today Trans. there are a lot of farmers doing this today Trans. 1 there are lots of of farmers doing this today Trans. 2 there are a lot farmers doing this today', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Theme', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'System Demonstrations', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Summarization', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Ethics and NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.2561185956001282, 0.06632572412490845, 0.06297528743743896, 0.06211836636066437, 0.045500848442316055, 0.04030287638306618, 0.03696184977889061, 0.03539068251848221, 0.033804357051849365, 0.03236536681652069, 0.030592946335673332, 0.028265269473195076, 0.027292994782328606, 0.026760002598166466, 0.025375282391905785, 0.02425362542271614, 0.024006374180316925, 0.022820761427283287, 0.018004609271883965, 0.017545495182275772, 0.017103904858231544, 0.014765167608857155, 0.014135968871414661, 0.013697981834411621, 0.012765061110258102, 0.010750642977654934]}",0.2561185956001282,Question Answering,0.06632572412490845
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Location Attention for Extrapolation to Longer Sequences,"Neural networks are surprisingly good at interpolating and perform remarkably well when the training set examples resemble those in the test set. However, they are often unable to extrapolate patterns beyond the seen data, even when the abstractions required for such patterns are simple. In this paper, we first review the notion of extrapolation, why it is important, and how one could hope to tackle it. We then focus on a specific type of extrapolation, which is especially useful for natural language processing: generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training. We hypothesize that models with a separate contentand location-based attention are more likely to extrapolate than those with common attention mechanisms. We empirically support our claim for recurrent seq2seq models with our proposed attention on variants of the Lookup Table task . This sheds light on some striking failures of neural models for sequences and on possible methods to approaching such issues.","{'sequence': 'Neural networks are surprisingly good at interpolating and perform remarkably well when the training set examples resemble those in the test set.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Inference Calibration of Neural Machine Translation,"Confidence calibration, which aims to make model predictions equal to the true correctness measures, is important for neural machine translation (NMT) because it is able to offer useful indicators of translation errors in the generated output. While prior studies have shown that NMT models trained with label smoothing are well-calibrated on the groundtruth training data, we find that miscalibration still remains a severe challenge for NMT during inference due to the discrepancy between training and inference. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, our work provides in-depth analyses of the correlation between calibration and translation performance as well as linguistic properties of miscalibration and reports a number of interesting findings that might help humans better analyze, understand and improve NMT models.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,BPE-Dropout: Simple and Effective Subword Regularization,"Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation. The dominant approach to subword segmentation is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which keeps the most frequent words intact while splitting the rare ones into multiple tokens. While multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary, BPE splits words into unique sequences; this may prevent a model from better learning the compositionality of words and being robust to segmentation errors. So far, the only way to overcome this BPE imperfection, its deterministic nature, was to create another subword segmentation algorithm (Kudo, 2018) . In contrast, we show that BPE itself incorporates the ability to produce multiple segmentations of the same word. We introduce BPE-dropout -simple and effective subword regularization method based on and compatible with conventional BPE. It stochastically corrupts the segmentation procedure of BPE, which leads to producing multiple segmentations within the same fixed BPE framework. Using BPE-dropout during training and the standard BPE during inference improves translation quality up to 2.3 BLEU compared to BPE and up to 0.9 BLEU compared to the previous subword regularization.","{'sequence': 'Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation.

Previous works show that multitask learning improves the ST performance, in which the recognition decoder generates the text of the source language, and the translation decoder obtains the final translations based on the output of the recognition decoder.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Hard-Coded Gaussian Attention for Neural Machine Translation,"Recent work has questioned the importance of the Transformer's multi-headed attention for achieving high translation quality. We push further in this direction by developing a ""hardcoded"" attention variant without any learned parameters. Surprisingly, replacing all learned self-attention heads in the encoder and decoder with fixed, input-agnostic Gaussian distributions minimally impacts BLEU scores across four different language pairs. However, additionally hard-coding cross attention (which connects the decoder to the encoder) significantly lowers BLEU, suggesting that it is more important than self-attention. Much of this BLEU drop can be recovered by adding just a single learned cross attention head to an otherwise hard-coded Transformer. Taken as a whole, our results offer insight into which components of the Transformer are actually important, which we hope will guide future work into the development of simpler and more efficient attention-based models.","{'sequence': 'Recent work has questioned the importance of the Transformer\'s multi-headed attention for achieving high translation quality.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Dynamically Adjusting Transformer Batch Size by Monitoring Gradient Direction Change,"The choice of hyper-parameters affects the performance of neural models. While much previous research (Sutskever et al., 2013; Duchi et al., 2011; Kingma and Ba, 2015) focuses on accelerating convergence and reducing the effects of the learning rate, comparatively few papers concentrate on the effect of batch size. In this paper, we analyze how increasing batch size affects gradient direction, and propose to evaluate the stability of gradients with their angle change. Based on our observations, the angle change of gradient direction first tends to stabilize (i.e. gradually decrease) while accumulating mini-batches, and then starts to fluctuate. We propose to automatically and dynamically determine batch sizes by accumulating gradients of mini-batches and performing an optimization step at just the time when the direction of gradients starts to fluctuate. To improve the efficiency of our approach for large models, we propose a sampling approach to select gradients of parameters sensitive to the batch size. Our approach dynamically determines proper and efficient batch sizes during training. In our experiments on the WMT 14 English to German and English to French tasks, our approach improves the Transformer with a fixed 25k batch size by +0.73 and +0.82 BLEU respectively.","{'sequence': 'The choice of hyper-parameters affects the performance of neural models.

Such NMT systems better translate humanproduced translations, i.e., translationese, but may largely worsen the translation quality of original texts. Our analysis reveals that adding a simple tag to back-translations prevents this quality degradation and improves on average the overall translation quality by helping the NMT system to distinguish back-translated data from original parallel data during training. We also show that, in contrast to high-resource configurations, NMT systems trained in lowresource settings are much less vulnerable to overfit back-translations.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Unsupervised Word Translation with Adversarial Autoencoder,"Crosslingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning crosslingual embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this article, we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with high-and low-resource languages from two different data sets show that our method achieves better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system. Along with performing comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of our adversarial model, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the refinement procedures to understand their effects.","{'sequence': 'Crosslingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Variational Neural Machine Translation with Normalizing Flows,"Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) is an attractive framework for modeling the generation of target translations, conditioned not only on the source sentence but also on some latent random variables. The latent variable modeling may introduce useful statistical dependencies that can improve translation accuracy. Unfortunately, learning informative latent variables is non-trivial, as the latent space can be prohibitively large, and the latent codes are prone to be ignored by many translation models at training time. Previous works impose strong assumptions on the distribution of the latent code and limit the choice of the NMT architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply the VNMT framework to the state-of-the-art Transformer and introduce a more flexible approximate posterior based on normalizing flows.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Reducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation Problem,"Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al., 2019) . Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a 'balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is 'catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a latticerescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al. (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of 'black box' online commercial MT systems. We demonstrate our approach translating from English into three languages with varied linguistic properties and data availability.","{'sequence': ""Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men.

Furthermore, we confirm that the parameter's initial sign and not its specific value is the primary factor for successful training, and show that magnitude pruning cannot be used to find winning lottery tickets."", 'labels': ['Theme', 'System Demonstrations', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Generation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'NLP Applications', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics'], 'scores': [0.07536090165376663, 0.07353372871875763, 0.06908527761697769, 0.0631071925163269, 0.05506601184606552, 0.05051429569721222, 0.046532779932022095, 0.04633261263370514, 0.0452328659594059, 0.04367600381374359, 0.04074189439415932, 0.036719609051942825, 0.031631067395210266, 0.0301369596272707, 0.029555588960647583, 0.028080087155103683, 0.027852695435285568, 0.027683516964316368, 0.026786556467413902, 0.025630030781030655, 0.02558695152401924, 0.024103691801428795, 0.022130673751235008, 0.020206743851304054, 0.018174728378653526, 0.016537634655833244]}",0.07536090165376663,Theme,0.05051429569721222
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Balancing Training for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"When training multilingual machine translation (MT) models that can translate to/from multiple languages, we are faced with imbalanced training sets: some languages have much more training data than others. Standard practice is to up-sample less resourced languages to increase representation, and the degree of up-sampling has a large effect on the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a method that instead automatically learns how to weight training data through a data scorer that is optimized to maximize performance on all test languages. Experiments on two sets of languages under both one-to-many and manyto-one MT settings show our method not only consistently outperforms heuristic baselines in terms of average performance, but also offers flexible control over the performance of which languages are optimized. 1","{'sequence': 'When training multilingual machine translation (MT) models that can translate to/from multiple languages, we are faced with imbalanced training sets: some languages have much more training data than others.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Learning Source Phrase Representations for Neural Machine Translation,"The Transformer translation model (Vaswani et al., 2017) based on a multi-head attention mechanism can be computed effectively in parallel and has significantly pushed forward the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Though intuitively the attentional network can connect distant words via shorter network paths than RNNs, empirical analysis demonstrates that it still has difficulty in fully capturing long-distance dependencies (Tang et al., 2018) . Considering that modeling phrases instead of words has significantly improved the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach through the use of larger translation blocks (""phrases"") and its reordering ability, modeling NMT at phrase level is an intuitive proposal to help the model capture long-distance relationships. In this paper, we first propose an attentive phrase representation generation mechanism which is able to generate phrase representations from corresponding token representations. In addition, we incorporate the generated phrase representations into the Transformer translation model to enhance its ability to capture long-distance relationships. In our experiments, we obtain significant improvements on the WMT 14 English-German and English-French tasks on top of the strong Transformer baseline, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach helps Transformer Base models perform at the level of Transformer Big models, and even significantly better for long sentences, but with substantially fewer parameters and training steps. The fact that phrase representations help even in the big setting further supports our conjecture that they make a valuable contribution to long-distance relations.","{'sequence': 'The Transformer translation model (Vaswani et al., 2017) based on a multi-head attention mechanism can be computed effectively in parallel and has significantly pushed forward the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Improving Massively Multilingual Neural Machine Translation and Zero-Shot Translation,"Massively multilingual models for neural machine translation (NMT) are theoretically attractive, but often underperform bilingual models and deliver poor zero-shot translations. In this paper, we explore ways to improve them. We argue that multilingual NMT requires stronger modeling capacity to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics, and overcome this bottleneck via language-specific components and deepening NMT architectures. We identify the off-target translation issue (i.e. translating into a wrong target language) as the major source of the inferior zero-shot performance, and propose random online backtranslation to enforce the translation of unseen training language pairs. Experiments on OPUS-100 (a novel multilingual dataset with 100 languages) show that our approach substantially narrows the performance gap with bilingual models in both oneto-many and many-to-many settings, and improves zero-shot performance by ∼10 BLEU, approaching conventional pivot-based methods. 1","{'sequence': 'Massively multilingual models for neural machine translation (NMT) are theoretically attractive, but often underperform bilingual models and deliver poor zero-shot translations.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Limitations of Cross-lingual Encoders as Exposed by Reference-Free Machine Translation Evaluation,"Evaluation of cross-lingual encoders is usually performed either via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in supervised downstream tasks or via unsupervised cross-lingual textual similarity. In this paper, we concern ourselves with reference-free machine translation (MT) evaluation where we directly compare source texts to (sometimes low-quality) system translations, which represents a natural adversarial setup for multilingual encoders. Referencefree evaluation holds the promise of web-scale comparison of MT systems. We systematically investigate a range of metrics based on state-of-the-art cross-lingual semantic representations obtained with pretrained M-BERT and LASER. We find that they perform poorly as semantic encoders for reference-free MT evaluation and identify their two key limitations, namely, (a) a semantic mismatch between representations of mutual translations and, more prominently, (b) the inability to punish ""translationese"", i.e., low-quality literal translations. We propose two partial remedies: (1) post-hoc re-alignment of the vector spaces and (2) coupling of semantic-similarity based metrics with target-side language modeling.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,It's Easier to Translate out of English than into it: Measuring Neural Translation Difficulty by Cross-Mutual Information,"The performance of neural machine translation systems is commonly evaluated in terms of BLEU.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Simple and Effective Unified Encoder for Document-Level Machine Translation,"Most of the existing models for documentlevel machine translation adopt dual-encoder structures. The representation of the source sentences and the document-level contexts 1 are modeled with two separate encoders.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Evaluating Robustness to Input Perturbations for Neural Machine Translation,Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are sensitive to small perturbations in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is typically measured using translation quality metrics such as BLEU on the noisy input. This paper proposes additional metrics which measure the relative degradation and changes in translation when small perturbations are added to the input. We focus on a class of models employing subword regularization to address robustness and perform extensive evaluations of these models using the robustness measures proposed. Results show that our proposed metrics reveal a clear trend of improved robustness to perturbations when subword regularization methods are used.,"{'sequence': 'Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are sensitive to small perturbations in the input.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Selecting Backtranslated Data from Multiple Sources for Improved Neural Machine Translation,"Machine translation (MT) has benefited from using synthetic training data originating from translating monolingual corpora, a technique known as backtranslation. Combining backtranslated data from different sources has led to better results than when using such data in isolation. In this work we analyse the impact that data translated with rule-based, phrasebased statistical and neural MT systems has on new MT systems. We use a real-world low-resource use-case (Basque-to-Spanish in the clinical domain) as well as a high-resource language pair (German-to-English) to test different scenarios with backtranslation and employ data selection to optimise the synthetic corpora. We exploit different data selection strategies in order to reduce the amount of data used, while at the same time maintaining highquality MT systems. We further tune the data selection method by taking into account the quality of the MT systems used for backtranslation and lexical diversity of the resulting corpora. Our experiments show that incorporating backtranslated data from different sources can be beneficial, and that availing of data selection can yield improved performance.","{'sequence': 'Machine translation (MT) has benefited from using synthetic training data originating from translating monolingual corpora, a technique known as backtranslation.

Aiming to tackle this problem, the natural language processing (NLP) community has experimented with a range of techniques for abuse detection. While achieving substantial success, these methods have so far only focused on modelling the linguistic properties of the comments and the online communities of users, disregarding the emotional state of the users and how this might affect their language. The latter is, however, inextricably linked to abusive behaviour. In this paper, we present the first joint model of emotion and abusive language detection, experimenting in a multi-task learning framework that allows one task to inform the other.

NLP Applications,Hiring Now: A Skill-Aware Multi-Attention Model for Job Posting Generation,"Writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process, but the task is often more difficult than many people think. It is challenging to specify the level of education, experience, relevant skills per the company information and job description. To this end, we propose a novel task of Job Posting Generation (JPG) that is cast as a conditional text generation problem to generate job requirements according to the job descriptions. To deal with this task, we devise a data-driven global Skill-Aware Multi-Attention generation model, named SAMA. Specifically, to model the complex mapping relationships between input and output, we design a hierarchical decoder that we first label the job description with multiple skills, then we generate a complete text guided by the skill labels. At the same time, to exploit the prior knowledge about the skills, we further construct a skill knowledge graph to capture the global prior knowledge of skills and refine the generated results. The proposed approach is evaluated on real-world job posting data. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method 1 .","{'sequence': 'Writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process, but the task is often more difficult than many people think.

NLP Applications,A Girl Has A Name: Detecting Authorship Obfuscation,"Authorship attribution aims to identify the author of a text based on the stylometric analysis. Authorship obfuscation, on the other hand, aims to protect against authorship attribution by modifying a text's style. In this paper, we evaluate the stealthiness of state-of-the-art authorship obfuscation methods under an adversarial threat model. An obfuscator is stealthy to the extent an adversary finds it challenging to detect whether or not a text modified by the obfuscator is obfuscated -a decision that is key to the adversary interested in authorship attribution. We show that the existing authorship obfuscation methods are not stealthy as their obfuscated texts can be identified with an average F1 score of 0.87. The reason for the lack of stealthiness is that these obfuscators degrade text smoothness, as ascertained by neural language models, in a detectable manner.

NLP Applications,CorefQA: Coreference Resolution as Query-based Span Prediction,"In this paper, we present CorefQA, an accurate and extensible approach for the coreference resolution task. We formulate the problem as a span prediction task, like in question answering: A query is generated for each candidate mention using its surrounding context, and a span prediction module is employed to extract the text spans of the coreferences within the document using the generated query. This formulation comes with the following key advantages: (1) The span prediction strategy provides the flexibility of retrieving mentions left out at the mention proposal stage; (2) In the question answering framework, encoding the mention and its context explicitly in a query makes it possible to have a deep and thorough examination of cues embedded in the context of coreferent mentions; and (3) A plethora of existing question answering datasets can be used for data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate significant performance boost over previous models, with 83.1 (+3.5) F1 score on the CoNLL-2012 benchmark and 87.5 (+2.5) F1 score on the GAP benchmark. 1","{'sequence': ""In this paper, we present CorefQA, an accurate and extensible approach for the coreference resolution task.

NLP Applications,Improving Segmentation for Technical Support Problems,"Technical support problems are often long and complex. They typically contain user descriptions of the problem, the setup, and steps for attempted resolution. Often they also contain various non-natural language text elements like outputs of commands, snippets of code, error messages or stack traces. These elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. However, they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. We formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task, and study the performance of state of the art approaches. We compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline, and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. We also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources, which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. Finally, we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval.","{'sequence': 'Technical support problems are often long and complex.

These elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. However, they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. We formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task, and study the performance of state of the art approaches. We compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline, and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. We also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources, which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. Finally, we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval.', 'labels': ['Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'System Demonstrations', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Generation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.059512972831726074, 0.05846979841589928, 0.0566098615527153, 0.05211195349693298, 0.05192232131958008, 0.045107364654541016, 0.04499250277876854, 0.04419384151697159, 0.04403333738446236, 0.042271215468645096, 0.04159894213080406, 0.03832725062966347, 0.03487497568130493, 0.03429965674877167, 0.03412686288356781, 0.033871427178382874, 0.0337911956012249, 0.033574145287275314, 0.03339632973074913, 0.032882869243621826, 0.030381599441170692, 0.03017507493495941, 0.02800242230296135, 0.022723903879523277, 0.02125645987689495, 0.01749173365533352]}",0.059512972831726074,Information Retrieval and Text Mining,0.04159894213080406
NLP Applications,Toxicity Detection: Does Context Really Matter?,"Moderation is crucial to promoting healthy online discussions. Although several 'toxicity' detection datasets and models have been published, most of them ignore the context of the posts, implicitly assuming that comments may be judged independently. We investigate this assumption by focusing on two questions: (a) does context affect the human judgement, and (b) does conditioning on context improve performance of toxicity detection systems? We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title. We find that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts. Moreover, a small but significant subset of manually labeled posts (5% in one of our experiments) end up having the opposite toxicity labels if the annotators are not provided with context. Surprisingly, we also find no evidence that context actually improves the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried a range of classifiers and mechanisms to make them context aware. This points to the need for larger datasets of comments annotated in context. We make our code and data publicly available.","{'sequence': ""Moderation is crucial to promoting healthy online discussions.

NLP Applications,Empowering Active Learning to Jointly Optimize System and User Demands,"Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training. However, when active learning is integrated with an end-user application, this can lead to frustration for participating users, as they spend time labeling instances that they would not otherwise be interested in reading. In this paper, we propose a new active learning approach that jointly optimizes the seemingly counteracting objectives of the active learning system (training efficiently) and the user (receiving useful instances). We study our approach in an educational application, which particularly benefits from this technique as the system needs to rapidly learn to predict the appropriateness of an exercise to a particular user, while the users should receive only exercises that match their skills. We evaluate multiple learning strategies and user types with data from real users and find that our joint approach better satisfies both objectives when alternative methods lead to many unsuitable exercises for end users. 1","{'sequence': 'Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training.

The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while they are of limited use for longer insertions.

NLP Applications,DeeBERT: Dynamic Early Exiting for Accelerating BERT Inference,"Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT have brought significant improvements to NLP applications. However, they are also notorious for being slow in inference, which makes them difficult to deploy in realtime applications. We propose a simple but effective method, DeeBERT, to accelerate BERT inference. Our approach allows samples to exit earlier without passing through the entire model. Experiments show that DeeBERT is able to save up to ∼40% inference time with minimal degradation in model quality.

NLP Applications,Investigating the effect of auxiliary objectives for the automated grading of learner English speech transcriptions,"We address the task of automatically grading the language proficiency of spontaneous speech based on textual features from automatic speech recognition transcripts. Motivated by recent advances in multi-task learning, we develop neural networks trained in a multi-task fashion that learn to predict the proficiency level of non-native English speakers by taking advantage of inductive transfer between the main task (grading) and auxiliary prediction tasks: morpho-syntactic labeling, language modeling, and native language identification (L1). We encode the transcriptions with both bi-directional recurrent neural networks and with bi-directional representations from transformers, compare against a featurerich baseline, and analyse performance at different proficiency levels and with transcriptions of varying error rates. Our best performance comes from a transformer encoder with L1 prediction as an auxiliary task.

NLP Applications,Language to Network: Conditional Parameter Adaptation with Natural Language Descriptions,"Transfer learning using ImageNet pre-trained models has been the de facto approach in a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, fine-tuning still requires task-specific training data. In this paper, we propose N 3 (Neural Networks from Natural Language) -a new paradigm of synthesizing task-specific neural networks from language descriptions and a generic pre-trained model. N 3 leverages language descriptions to generate parameter adaptations as well as a new task-specific classification layer for a pre-trained neural network, effectively ""fine-tuning"" the network for a new task using only language descriptions as input. To the best of our knowledge, N 3 is the first method to synthesize entire neural networks from natural language. Experimental results show that N 3 can out-perform previous natural-language based zero-shot learning methods across 4 different zero-shot image classification benchmarks.

NLP Applications,Fine-grained Interest Matching for Neural News Recommendation,"Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to improve users' online news reading experience. The core of news recommendation is accurate matching between user's interests and candidate news. The same user usually has diverse interests that are reflected in different news she has browsed. Meanwhile, important semantic features of news are implied in text segments of different granularities. Existing studies generally represent each user as a single vector and then match the candidate news vector, which may lose fine-grained information for recommendation. In this paper, we propose FIM, a Finegrained Interest Matching method for neural news recommendation. Instead of aggregating user's all historical browsed news into a unified vector, we hierarchically construct multilevel representations for each news via stacked dilated convolutions. Then we perform finegrained matching between segment pairs of each browsed news and the candidate news at each semantic level. High-order salient signals are then identified by resembling the hierarchy of image recognition for final click prediction. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from MSN news validate the effectiveness of our model on news recommendation.","{'sequence': ""Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to improve users' online news reading experience.

NLP Applications,Predicting Performance for Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Given the complexity of combinations of tasks, languages, and domains in natural language processing (NLP) research, it is computationally prohibitive to exhaustively test newly proposed models on each possible experimental setting.

To do so, we build regression models to predict the evaluation score of an NLP experiment given the experimental settings as input. Experimenting on 9 different NLP tasks, we find that our predictors can produce meaningful predictions over unseen languages and different modeling architectures, outperforming reasonable baselines as well as human experts.

NLP Applications,Encoder-Decoder Models Can Benefit from Pre-trained Masked Language Models in Grammatical Error Correction,"This paper investigates how to effectively incorporate a pre-trained masked language model (MLM), such as BERT, into an encoderdecoder (EncDec) model for grammatical error correction (GEC). The answer to this question is not as straightforward as one might expect because the previous common methods for incorporating a MLM into an EncDec model have potential drawbacks when applied to GEC. For example, the distribution of the inputs to a GEC model can be considerably different (erroneous, clumsy, etc.) from that of the corpora used for pre-training MLMs; however, this issue is not addressed in the previous methods. Our experiments show that our proposed method, where we first fine-tune a MLM with a given GEC corpus and then use the output of the finetuned MLM as additional features in the GEC model, maximizes the benefit of the MLM. The best-performing model achieves state-ofthe-art performances on the BEA-2019 and CoNLL-2014 benchmarks.

NLP Applications,Graph Neural News Recommendation with Unsupervised Preference Disentanglement,"With the explosion of news information, personalized news recommendation has become very important for users to quickly find their interested contents.

In this paper, we model the usernews interactions as a bipartite graph and propose a novel Graph Neural News Recommendation model with Unsupervised Preference Disentanglement, named GNUD. Our model can encode high-order relationships into user and news representations by information propagation along the graph.

NLP Applications,SPECTER: Document-level Representation Learning using Citation-informed Transformers,"Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token-and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SCIDOCS, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark. 1 * Equal contribution 1 https://github.com/allenai/specter A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for sentence embeddings.

NLP Applications,From Zero to Hero: Human-In-The-Loop Entity Linking in Low Resource Domains,"Entity linking (EL) is concerned with disambiguating entity mentions in a text against knowledge bases (KB). It is crucial in a considerable number of fields like humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge. The use of EL in such domains requires handling noisy texts, low resource settings and domain-specific KBs. Existing approaches are mostly inappropriate for this, as they depend on training data. However, in the above scenario, there exists hardly annotated data, and it needs to be created from scratch. We therefore present a novel domain-agnostic Human-In-The-Loop annotation approach: we use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate ranking, thereby speeding up the overall annotation process and making it less tedious for users. We evaluate our ranking approach in a simulation on difficult texts and show that it greatly outperforms a strong baseline in ranking accuracy. In a user study, the annotation speed improves by 35 % compared to annotating without interactive support; users report that they strongly prefer our system.

NLP Applications,Hyperbolic Capsule Networks for Multi-Label Classification,"Although deep neural networks are effective at extracting high-level features, classification methods usually encode an input into a vector representation via simple feature aggregation operations (e.g. pooling). Such operations limit the performance. For instance, a multi-label document may contain several concepts. In this case, one vector can not sufficiently capture its salient and discriminative content. Thus, we propose Hyperbolic Capsule Networks (HYPERCAPS) for Multi-Label Classification (MLC), which have two merits. First, hyperbolic capsules are designed to capture fine-grained document information for each label, which has the ability to characterize complicated structures among labels and documents. Second, Hyperbolic Dynamic Routing (HDR) is introduced to aggregate hyperbolic capsules in a label-aware manner, so that the label-level discriminative information can be preserved along the depth of neural networks. To efficiently handle large-scale MLC datasets, we additionally present a new routing method to adaptively adjust the capsule number during routing. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets.

NLP Applications,Understanding Advertisements with BERT,"We consider a task based on CVPR 2018 challenge dataset on advertisement (Ad) understanding.

Motivated by this, we fine-tune the base BERT model for a sentencepair classification task. Despite utilizing the scene-text as the only source of visual information, we could achieve a hit-or-miss accuracy of 84.95% on the challenge test data. To enable BERT to process other visual information, we append image captions to the scene-text. This achieves an accuracy of 89.69%, which is an improvement of 4.7%.

NLP Applications,Spelling Error Correction with Soft-Masked BERT,"Spelling error correction is an important yet challenging task because a satisfactory solution of it essentially needs human-level language understanding ability. Without loss of generality we consider Chinese spelling error correction (CSC) in this paper. A state-ofthe-art method for the task selects a character from a list of candidates for correction (including non-correction) at each position of the sentence on the basis of BERT, the language representation model. The accuracy of the method can be sub-optimal, however, because BERT does not have sufficient capability to detect whether there is an error at each position, apparently due to the way of pre-training it using mask language modeling. In this work, we propose a novel neural architecture to address the aforementioned issue, which consists of a network for error detection and a network for error correction based on BERT, with the former being connected to the latter with what we call soft-masking technique. Our method of using 'Soft-Masked BERT' is general, and it may be employed in other language detectioncorrection problems.

NLP Applications,Clinical Concept Linking with Contextualized Neural Representations,"In traditional approaches to entity linking, linking decisions are based on three sources of information -the similarity of the mention string to an entity's name, the similarity of the context of the document to the entity, and broader information about the knowledge base (KB). In some domains, there is little contextual information present in the KB and thus we rely more heavily on mention string similarity. We consider one example of this, concept linking, which seeks to link mentions of medical concepts to a medical concept ontology. We propose an approach to concept linking that leverages recent work in contextualized neural models, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) , which create a token representation that integrates the surrounding context of the mention and concept name.

In some domains, there is little contextual information present in the KB and thus we rely more heavily on mention string similarity. We consider one example of this, concept linking, which seeks to link mentions of medical concepts to a medical concept ontology. We propose an approach to concept linking that leverages recent work in contextualized neural models, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) , which create a token representation that integrates the surrounding context of the mention and concept name.

NLP Applications,Efficient Strategies for Hierarchical Text Classification: External Knowledge and Auxiliary Tasks,"In hierarchical text classification, we perform a sequence of inference steps to predict the category of a document from top to bottom of a given class taxonomy. Most of the studies have focused on developing novels neural network architectures to deal with the hierarchical structure, but we prefer to look for efficient ways to strengthen a baseline model. We first define the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Afterwards, we propose an auxiliary synthetic task of bottom-up-classification. Then, from external dictionaries, we retrieve textual definitions for the classes of all the hierarchy's layers, and map them into the word vector space. We use the class-definition embeddings as an additional input to condition the prediction of the next layer and in an adapted beam search. Whereas the modified search did not provide large gains, the combination of the auxiliary task and the additional input of classdefinitions significantly enhance the classification accuracy. With our efficient approaches, we outperform previous studies, using a drastically reduced number of parameters, in two well-known English datasets.","{'sequence': ""In hierarchical text classification, we perform a sequence of inference steps to predict the category of a document from top to bottom of a given class taxonomy.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-speech Tagging via Two-way Attentions of Auto-analyzed Knowledge,"Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and partof-speech (POS) tagging are important fundamental tasks for Chinese language processing, where joint learning of them is an effective one-step solution for both tasks. Previous studies for joint CWS and POS tagging mainly follow the character-based tagging paradigm with introducing contextual information such as n-gram features or sentential representations from recurrent neural models. However, for many cases, the joint tagging needs not only modeling from context features but also knowledge attached to them (e.g., syntactic relations among words); limited efforts have been made by existing research to meet such needs. In this paper, we propose a neural model named TWASP for joint CWS and POS tagging following the character-based sequence labeling paradigm, where a two-way attention mechanism is used to incorporate both context feature and their corresponding syntactic knowledge for each input character. Particularly, we use existing language processing toolkits to obtain the auto-analyzed syntactic knowledge for the context, and the proposed attention module can learn and benefit from them although their quality may not be perfect.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Predicting Declension Class from Form and Meaning,"The noun lexica of many natural languages are divided into several declension classes with characteristic morphological properties. Class membership is far from deterministic, but the phonological form of a noun and its meaning can often provide imperfect clues. Here, we investigate the strength of those clues. More specifically, we operationalize ""strength"" as measuring how much information, in bits, we can glean about declension class from knowing the form and meaning of nouns. We know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender-which, as we quantitatively verify, can itself share information with declension class-so we also control for gender. We find for two Indo-European languages (Czech and German) that form and meaning share a significant amount of information with class (and contribute additional information beyond gender). The three-way interaction between class, form, and meaning (given gender) is also significant. Our study is important for two reasons: First, we introduce a new method that provides additional quantitative support for a classic linguistic finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into declensions. Second, we show not only that individual declension classes vary in the strength of their clues within a language, but also that the variations between classes vary across languages.

For adversarial training, we develop a sentence-level training procedure to perform noise reduction and maximum utilization of the source domain information.

"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",Improving Chinese Word Segmentation with Wordhood Memory Networks,"Contextual features always play an important role in Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Wordhood information, being one of the contextual features, is proved to be useful in many conventional character-based segmenters. However, this feature receives less attention in recent neural models and it is also challenging to design a framework that can properly integrate wordhood information from different wordhood measures to existing neural frameworks.

Question Answering,DeFormer: Decomposing Pre-trained Transformers for Faster Question Answering,"Transformer-based QA models use input-wide self-attention -i.e. across both the question and the input passage -at all layers, causing them to be slow and memory-intensive. It turns out that we can get by without inputwide self-attention at all layers, especially in the lower layers. We introduce DeFormer, a decomposed transformer, which substitutes the full self-attention with question-wide and passage-wide self-attentions in the lower layers. This allows for question-independent processing of the input text representations, which in turn enables pre-computing passage representations reducing runtime compute drastically. Furthermore, because DeFormer is largely similar to the original model, we can initialize DeFormer with the pre-training weights of a standard transformer, and directly fine-tune on the target QA dataset. We show DeFormer versions of BERT and XLNet can be used to speed up QA by over 4.3x and with simple distillation-based losses they incur only a 1% drop in accuracy.

We introduce DeFormer, a decomposed transformer, which substitutes the full self-attention with question-wide and passage-wide self-attentions in the lower layers. This allows for question-independent processing of the input text representations, which in turn enables pre-computing passage representations reducing runtime compute drastically. Furthermore, because DeFormer is largely similar to the original model, we can initialize DeFormer with the pre-training weights of a standard transformer, and directly fine-tune on the target QA dataset. We show DeFormer versions of BERT and XLNet can be used to speed up QA by over 4.3x and with simple distillation-based losses they incur only a 1% drop in accuracy.

Question Answering,Unsupervised Alignment-based Iterative Evidence Retrieval for Multi-hop Question Answering,"Evidence retrieval is a critical stage of question answering (QA), necessary not only to improve performance, but also to explain the decisions of the corresponding QA method. We introduce a simple, fast, and unsupervised iterative evidence retrieval method, which relies on three ideas: (a) an unsupervised alignment approach to soft-align questions and answers with justification sentences using only GloVe embeddings, (b) an iterative process that reformulates queries focusing on terms that are not covered by existing justifications, which (c) a stopping criterion that terminates retrieval when the terms in the given question and candidate answers are covered by the retrieved justifications. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms all the previous methods (including supervised methods) on the evidence selection task on two datasets: MultiRC and QASC.

Question Answering,Improving Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using Knowledge Base Embeddings,"Knowledge Graphs (KG) are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities as nodes and relations among them as typed edges. Goal of the Question Answering over KG (KGQA) task is to answer natural language queries posed over the KG. Multi-hop KGQA requires reasoning over multiple edges of the KG to arrive at the right answer. KGs are often incomplete with many missing links, posing additional challenges for KGQA, especially for multi-hop KGQA. Recent research on multihop KGQA has attempted to handle KG sparsity using relevant external text, which isn't always readily available. In a separate line of research, KG embedding methods have been proposed to reduce KG sparsity by performing missing link prediction. Such KG embedding methods, even though highly relevant, have not been explored for multi-hop KGQA so far. We fill this gap in this paper and propose EmbedKGQA. EmbedKGQA is particularly effective in performing multi-hop KGQA over sparse KGs. EmbedKGQA also relaxes the requirement of answer selection from a prespecified neighborhood, a sub-optimal constraint enforced by previous multi-hop KGQA methods. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate EmbedKGQA's effectiveness over other stateof-the-art baselines.","{'sequence': ""Knowledge Graphs (KG) are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities as nodes and relations among them as typed edges.

Question Answering,A Self-Training Method for Machine Reading Comprehension with Soft Evidence Extraction,"Neural models have achieved great success on machine reading comprehension (MRC), many of which typically consist of two components: an evidence extractor and an answer predictor. The former seeks the most relevant information from a reference text, while the latter is to locate or generate answers from the extracted evidence. Despite the importance of evidence labels for training the evidence extractor, they are not cheaply accessible, particularly in many non-extractive MRC tasks such as YES/NO question answering and multi-choice MRC. To address this problem, we present a Self-Training method (STM), which supervises the evidence extractor with auto-generated evidence labels in an iterative process. At each iteration, a base MRC model is trained with golden answers and noisy evidence labels. The trained model will predict pseudo evidence labels as extra supervision in the next iteration. We evaluate STM on seven datasets over three MRC tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement on existing MRC models, and we also analyze how and why such a self-training method works in MRC.","{'sequence': 'Neural models have achieved great success on machine reading comprehension (MRC), many of which typically consist of two components: an evidence extractor and an answer predictor.

Question Answering,Multi-source Meta Transfer for Low Resource Multiple-Choice Question Answering,"Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is one of the most challenging tasks in machine reading comprehension since it requires more advanced reading comprehension skills such as logical reasoning, summarization, and arithmetic operations. Unfortunately, most existing MCQA datasets are small in size, which increases the difficulty of model learning and generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-source meta transfer (MMT) for low-resource MCQA. In this framework, we first extend meta learning by incorporating multiple training sources to learn a generalized feature representation across domains. To bridge the distribution gap between training sources and the target, we further introduce the meta transfer that can be integrated into the multi-source meta training. More importantly, the proposed MMT is independent of backbone language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MMT over state-of-the-arts, and continuous improvements can be achieved on different backbone networks on both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings.","{'sequence': 'Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is one of the most challenging tasks in machine reading comprehension since it requires more advanced reading comprehension skills such as logical reasoning, summarization, and arithmetic operations.

Question Answering,Clinical Reading Comprehension: A Thorough Analysis of the emrQA Dataset,"Machine reading comprehension has made great progress in recent years owing to largescale annotated datasets. In the clinical domain, however, creating such datasets is quite difficult due to the domain expertise required for annotation. Recently, Pampari et al. (2018)   tackled this issue by using expert-annotated question templates and existing i2b2 annotations to create emrQA, the first large-scale dataset for question answering (QA) based on clinical notes. In this paper, we provide an indepth analysis of this dataset and the clinical reading comprehension (CliniRC) task. From our qualitative analysis, we find that (i) emrQA answers are often incomplete, and (ii) emrQA questions are often answerable without using domain knowledge. From our quantitative experiments, surprising results include that (iii) using a small sampled subset (5%-20%), we can obtain roughly equal performance compared to the model trained on the entire dataset, (iv) this performance is close to human expert's performance, and (v) BERT models do not beat the best performing base model. Following our analysis of the emrQA, we further explore two desired aspects of CliniRC systems: the ability to utilize clinical domain knowledge and to generalize to unseen questions and contexts. We argue that both should be considered when creating future datasets. 1","{'sequence': ""Machine reading comprehension has made great progress in recent years owing to largescale annotated datasets.

Question Answering,Explicit Memory Tracker with Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Conversational Machine Reading,"The goal of conversational machine reading is to answer user questions given a knowledge base text which may require asking clarification questions. Existing approaches are limited in their decision making due to struggles in extracting question-related rules and reasoning about them.

Moreover, our framework generates clarification questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level entailment scores to weight token-level distributions. On the ShARC benchmark (blind, heldout) testset, EMT achieves new state-of-theart results of 74.6% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 49.5 BLEU4. We also show that EMT is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented reasoning process as the conversation flows.

We also show that standard QG evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR are inversely correlated with diversity, and propose a diversity-aware intrinsic measure of overall QG quality that correlates well with extrinsic evaluation on QA. 1 http://aqleaderboard.tomhosking.co.uk/squad', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Generation', 'Theme', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'System Demonstrations', 'Information Extraction', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.26857098937034607, 0.0963282510638237, 0.051241301000118256, 0.05051571503281593, 0.04811616241931915, 0.036704376339912415, 0.03526046872138977, 0.03335810452699661, 0.03260519728064537, 0.030576229095458984, 0.028385847806930542, 0.02823103591799736, 0.027760300785303116, 0.023359455168247223, 0.02142231911420822, 0.02064252831041813, 0.02007180266082287, 0.019205903634428978, 0.018074549734592438, 0.017698071897029877, 0.01747172698378563, 0.017203908413648605, 0.016474111005663872, 0.016192886978387833, 0.01417347602546215, 0.010355385020375252]}",0.26857098937034607,Question Answering,0.26857098937034607
Question Answering,RikiNet: Reading Wikipedia Pages for Natural Question Answering,"Reading long documents to answer opendomain questions remains challenging in natural language understanding. In this paper, we introduce a new model, called RikiNet, which reads Wikipedia pages for natural question answering. RikiNet contains a dynamic paragraph dual-attention reader and a multi-level cascaded answer predictor. The reader dynamically represents the document and question by utilizing a set of complementary attention mechanisms. The representations are then fed into the predictor to obtain the span of the short answer, the paragraph of the long answer, and the answer type in a cascaded manner. On the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, a single RikiNet achieves 74.3 F1 and 57.9 F1 on longanswer and short-answer tasks. To our best knowledge, it is the first single model that outperforms the single human performance. Furthermore, an ensemble RikiNet obtains 76.1 F1 and 61.3 F1 on long-answer and shortanswer tasks, achieving the best performance on the official NQ leaderboard 1 .","{'sequence': 'Reading long documents to answer opendomain questions remains challenging in natural language understanding.

Question Answering,Low-Resource Generation of Multi-hop Reasoning Questions,"This paper focuses on generating multi-hop reasoning questions from the raw text in a low resource circumstance. Such questions have to be syntactically valid and need to logically correlate with the answers by deducing over multiple relations on several sentences in the text. Specifically, we first build a multi-hop generation model and guide it to satisfy the logical rationality by the reasoning chain extracted from a given text. Since the labeled data is limited and insufficient for training, we propose to learn the model with the help of a large scale of unlabeled data that is much easier to obtain. Such data contains rich expressive forms of the questions with structural patterns on syntax and semantics. These patterns can be estimated by the neural hidden semi-Markov model using latent variables. With latent patterns as a prior, we can regularize the generation model and produce the optimal results. Experimental results on the HotpotQA data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Moreover, we apply the generated results to the task of machine reading comprehension and achieve significant performance improvements.","{'sequence': 'This paper focuses on generating multi-hop reasoning questions from the raw text in a low resource circumstance.

Question Answering,ClarQ: A large-scale and diverse dataset for Clarification Question Generation,"Question answering and conversational systems are often baffled and need help clarifying certain ambiguities. However, limitations of existing datasets hinder the development of large-scale models capable of generating and utilising clarification questions. In order to overcome these limitations, we devise a novel bootstrapping framework (based on self-supervision) that assists in the creation of a diverse, large-scale dataset of clarification questions based on post-comment tuples extracted from stackexchange. The framework utilises a neural network based architecture for classifying clarification questions. It is a two-step method where the first aims to increase the precision of the classifier and second aims to increase its recall. We quantitatively demonstrate the utility of the newly created dataset by applying it to the downstream task of question-answering. The final dataset, ClarQ, consists of ∼2M examples distributed across 173 domains of stackexchange. We release this dataset 1 in order to foster research into the field of clarification question generation with the larger goal of enhancing dialog and question answering systems.","{'sequence': 'Question answering and conversational systems are often baffled and need help clarifying certain ambiguities.

Question Answering,Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension,"In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer. State-of-the-art models tend to use a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to encode the joint contextual information of document and question. However, these transformer-based models can only take a fixed-length (e.g., 512) text as its input. To deal with even longer text inputs, previous approaches usually chunk them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each segment independently without considering the information from other segments. As a result, they may form segments that fail to cover the correct answer span or retain insufficient contexts around it, which significantly degrades the performance. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need cross-segment information. We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next segment that it wants to process in either direction. We also employ recurrent mechanisms to enable information to flow across segments. Experiments on three MRC datasets -CoQA, QuAC, and TriviaQA -demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed recurrent chunking mechanisms: we can obtain segments that are more likely to contain complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the ground truth answers for better predictions.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer.

Experiments show that our automatic evaluation metrics using multiple reference derivations are reliable, and that R 4 C assesses different skills from an existing benchmark."", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Theme', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'System Demonstrations', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Summarization', 'NLP Applications', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Generation', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.15572907030582428, 0.10769867151975632, 0.08117710053920746, 0.08028849214315414, 0.06316453963518143, 0.05184362083673477, 0.03389932960271835, 0.0325479656457901, 0.030647095292806625, 0.028895428404211998, 0.026974216103553772, 0.02679513953626156, 0.02555404044687748, 0.025093941017985344, 0.024748392403125763, 0.02453160658478737, 0.02373989298939705, 0.02339066006243229, 0.02326875738799572, 0.021918660029768944, 0.018089933320879936, 0.017989659681916237, 0.014263516291975975, 0.013777608051896095, 0.013483095914125443, 0.010489496402442455]}",0.15572907030582428,Question Answering,0.15572907030582428
Question Answering,Document Modeling with Graph Attention Networks for Multi-grained Machine Reading Comprehension,"Natural Questions is a new challenging machine reading comprehension benchmark with two-grained answers, which are a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities inside the long answer). Despite the effectiveness of existing methods on this benchmark, they treat these two sub-tasks individually during training while ignoring their dependencies. To address this issue, we present a novel multi-grained machine reading comprehension framework that focuses on modeling documents at their hierarchical nature, which are different levels of granularity: documents, paragraphs, sentences, and tokens. We utilize graph attention networks to obtain different levels of representations so that they can be learned simultaneously. The long and short answers can be extracted from paragraphlevel representation and token-level representation, respectively. In this way, we can model the dependencies between the two-grained answers to provide evidence for each other. We jointly train the two sub-tasks, and our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous systems at both long and short answer criteria.","{'sequence': 'Natural Questions is a new challenging machine reading comprehension benchmark with two-grained answers, which are a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities inside the long answer).

Question Answering,Injecting Numerical Reasoning Skills into Language Models,"Large pre-trained language models (LMs) are known to encode substantial amounts of linguistic information. However, high-level reasoning skills, such as numerical reasoning, are difficult to learn from a language-modeling objective only. Consequently, existing models for numerical reasoning have used specialized architectures with limited flexibility. In this work, we show that numerical reasoning is amenable to automatic data generation, and thus one can inject this skill into pre-trained LMs, by generating large amounts of data, and training in a multi-task setup. We show that pre-training our model, GENBERT, on this data, dramatically improves performance on DROP (49.3 → 72.3 F 1 ), reaching performance that matches state-of-the-art models of comparable size, while using a simple and general-purpose encoder-decoder architecture. Moreover, GENBERT generalizes well to math word problem datasets, while maintaining high performance on standard RC tasks. Our approach provides a general recipe for injecting skills into large pre-trained LMs, whenever the skill is amenable to automatic data augmentation.","{'sequence': 'Large pre-trained language models (LMs) are known to encode substantial amounts of linguistic information.

Question Answering,Selective Question Answering under Domain Shift,"To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering. Moreover, users often ask questions that diverge from the model's training data, making errors more likely and thus abstention more critical. In this work, we propose the setting of selective question answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a mixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain on) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuADtrained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy.","{'sequence': ""To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering.

A common approach to QA has been to fine-tune a pretrained language model on a task-specific labeled dataset.

Question Answering,SCDE: Sentence Cloze Dataset with High Quality Distractors From Examinations,"We introduce SCDE, a dataset to evaluate the performance of computational models through sentence prediction. SCDE is a humancreated sentence cloze dataset, collected from public school English examinations. Our task requires a model to fill up multiple blanks in a passage from a shared candidate set with distractors designed by English teachers. Experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local, discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. The blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each other's context. Furthermore, through ablations, we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging. Our experiments show that there is a significant performance gap between advanced models (72%) and humans (87%), encouraging future models to bridge this gap. 1 2 * Equal Contribution 1 Data: vgtomahawk.github.io/sced.html 2 Code: https://github.com/shawnkx/SCDE Passage: A student's life is never easy.

Question Answering,A Methodology for Creating Question Answering Corpora Using Inverse Data Annotation,"In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data. For this, we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database called Operation Trees (OT). This representation allows us to invert the annotation process without losing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our corpus is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to increase the performance significantly.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data.

Question Answering,Learning to Identify Follow-Up Questions in Conversational Question Answering,"Despite recent progress in conversational question answering, most prior work does not focus on follow-up questions. Practical conversational question answering systems often receive follow-up questions in an ongoing conversation, and it is crucial for a system to be able to determine whether a question is a follow-up question of the current conversation, for more effective answer finding subsequently. In this paper, we introduce a new follow-up question identification task. We propose a three-way attentive pooling network that determines the suitability of a follow-up question by capturing pair-wise interactions between the associated passage, the conversation history, and a candidate follow-up question. It enables the model to capture topic continuity and topic shift while scoring a particular candidate follow-up question.

Question Answering,Benefits of Intermediate Annotations in Reading Comprehension,"Complex, compositional reading comprehension datasets require performing latent sequential decisions that are learned via supervision from the final answer. A large combinatorial space of possible decision paths that result in the same answer, compounded by the lack of intermediate supervision to help choose the right path, makes the learning particularly hard for this task. In this work, we study the benefits of collecting intermediate reasoning supervision along with the answer during data collection. We find that these intermediate annotations can provide two-fold benefits. First, we observe that for any collection budget, spending a fraction of it on intermediate annotations results in improved model performance, for two complex compositional datasets: DROP and Quoref. Second, these annotations encourage the model to learn the correct latent reasoning steps, helping combat some of the biases introduced during the data collection process.","{'sequence': 'Complex, compositional reading comprehension datasets require performing latent sequential decisions that are learned via supervision from the final answer.

Question Answering,Enhancing Answer Boundary Detection for Multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension,"Multilingual pre-trained models could leverage the training data from a rich source language (such as English) to improve the performance on low resource languages. However, the transfer effectiveness on the multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task is substantially poorer than that for sentence classification tasks, mainly due to the requirement of MRC to detect the word level answer boundary. In this paper, we propose two auxiliary tasks to introduce additional phrase boundary supervision in the fine-tuning stage: (1) a mixed MRC task, which translates the question or passage to other languages and builds cross-lingual question-passage pairs; and (2) a language-agnostic knowledge masking task by leveraging knowledge phrases mined from the Web. Extensive experiments on two cross-lingual MRC datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","{'sequence': 'Multilingual pre-trained models could leverage the training data from a rich source language (such as English) to improve the performance on low resource languages.

Question Answering,Contextualized Sparse Representations for Real-Time Open-Domain Question Answering,"Open-domain question answering can be formulated as a phrase retrieval problem, in which we can expect huge scalability and speed benefit but often suffer from low accuracy due to the limitation of existing phrase representation models. In this paper, we aim to improve the quality of each phrase embedding by augmenting it with a contextualized sparse representation (SPARC). Unlike previous sparse vectors that are term-frequencybased (e.g., tf-idf) or directly learned (only few thousand dimensions), we leverage rectified self-attention to indirectly learn sparse vectors in n-gram vocabulary space. By augmenting the previous phrase retrieval model (Seo et al., 2019) with SPARC, we show 4%+ improvement in CuratedTREC and SQuAD-Open.

Question Answering,DoQA - Accessing Domain-Specific FAQs via Conversational QA,"The goal of this work is to build conversational Question Answering (QA) interfaces for the large body of domain-specific information available in FAQ sites. We present DoQA, a dataset with 2,437 dialogues and 10,917 QA pairs. The dialogues are collected from three Stack Exchange sites using the Wizard of Oz method with crowdsourcing. Compared to previous work, DoQA comprises well-defined information needs, leading to more coherent and natural conversations with less factoid questions and is multi-domain. In addition, we introduce a more realistic information retrieval (IR) scenario where the system needs to find the answer in any of the FAQ documents. The results of an existing, strong, system show that, thanks to transfer learning from a Wikipedia QA dataset and fine tuning on a single FAQ domain, it is possible to build high quality conversational QA systems for FAQs without indomain training data. The good results carry over into the more challenging IR scenario. In both cases, there is still ample room for improvement, as indicated by the higher human upperbound.","{'sequence': 'The goal of this work is to build conversational Question Answering (QA) interfaces for the large body of domain-specific information available in FAQ sites.

Resources and Evaluation,Towards Holistic and Automatic Evaluation of Open-Domain Dialogue Generation,"Open-domain dialogue generation has gained increasing attention in Natural Language Processing. Its evaluation requires a holistic means. Human ratings are deemed as the gold standard. As human evaluation is inefficient and costly, an automated substitute is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose holistic evaluation metrics that capture different aspects of open-domain dialogues. Our metrics consist of (1) GPT-2 based context coherence between sentences in a dialogue, (2) GPT-2 based fluency in phrasing, (3) n-gram based diversity in responses to augmented queries, and (4) textual-entailment-inference based logical self-consistency. The empirical validity of our metrics is demonstrated by strong correlations with human judgments.

Finally, we turn to pairwise system ranking, developing a method for thresholding performance improvement under an automatic metric against human judgements, which allows quantification of type I versus type II errors incurred, i.e., insignificant human differences in system quality that are accepted, and significant human differences that are rejected.

Experimental results prove that even though pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising progress on the original WSC dataset, they are still struggling at WinoWhy.

Resources and Evaluation,STARC: Structured Annotations for Reading Comprehension,"We present STARC (Structured Annotations for Reading Comprehension), a new annotation framework for assessing reading comprehension with multiple choice questions. Our framework introduces a principled structure for the answer choices and ties them to textual span annotations. The framework is implemented in OneStopQA, a new high-quality dataset for evaluation and analysis of reading comprehension in English. We use this dataset to demonstrate that STARC can be leveraged for a key new application for the development of SAT-like reading comprehension materials: automatic annotation quality probing via span ablation experiments. We further show that it enables in-depth analyses and comparisons between machine and human reading comprehension behavior, including error distributions and guessing ability. Our experiments also reveal that the standard multiple choice dataset in NLP, RACE (Lai et al., 2017) , is limited in its ability to measure reading comprehension. 47% of its questions can be guessed by machines without accessing the passage, and 18% are unanimously judged by humans as not having a unique correct answer.

By providing the iSarcasm dataset, we aim to encourage future NLP research to develop methods for detecting sarcasm in text as intended by the authors of the text, not as labeled under assumptions that we demonstrate to be sub-optimal.', 'labels': ['Speech and Multimodality', 'System Demonstrations', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Question Answering', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Theme', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07263180613517761, 0.05931801721453667, 0.059199411422014236, 0.05547467991709709, 0.049093350768089294, 0.04604288935661316, 0.0445750392973423, 0.044004395604133606, 0.04176319018006325, 0.0404207780957222, 0.04041924700140953, 0.03833672031760216, 0.03790314868092537, 0.03759229928255081, 0.036537811160087585, 0.03612915053963661, 0.034804005175828934, 0.03418593108654022, 0.032827358692884445, 0.030276918783783913, 0.02717476710677147, 0.024996289983391762, 0.023299291729927063, 0.022180015221238136, 0.019114186987280846, 0.01169932633638382]}",0.07263180613517761,Speech and Multimodality,0.03612915053963661

We argue that speaker-related information plays a critical role in the proposed task, based on an analysis of similarities and differences between dialogue-based and traditional RE tasks. Considering the timeliness of communication in a dialogue, we design a new metric to evaluate the performance of RE methods in a conversational setting and investigate the performance of several representative RE methods on DialogRE.

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models.

Resources and Evaluation,Improving Image Captioning Evaluation by Considering Inter References Variance,"Evaluating image captions is very challenging partially due to the fact that there are multiple correct captions for every single image. Most of the existing one-to-one metrics operate by penalizing mismatches between reference and generative caption without considering the intrinsic variance between ground truth captions.

Recently, the latest one-to-one metric BERTScore can achieve high human correlation in system-level tasks while some issues can be fixed for better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel metric based on BERTScore that could handle such a challenge and extend BERTScore with a few new features appropriately for image captioning evaluation.

Resources and Evaluation,GLUECoS: An Evaluation Benchmark for Code-Switched NLP,"Code-switching is the use of more than one language in the same conversation or utterance. Recently, multilingual contextual embedding models, trained on multiple monolingual corpora, have shown promising results on cross-lingual and multilingual tasks. We present an evaluation benchmark, GLUECoS, for code-switched languages, that spans several NLP tasks in English-Hindi and English-Spanish. Specifically, our evaluation benchmark includes Language Identification from text, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering and a new task for code-switching, Natural Language Inference. We present results on all these tasks using cross-lingual word embedding models and multilingual models. In addition, we fine-tune multilingual models on artificially generated code-switched data. Although multilingual models perform significantly better than cross-lingual models, our results show that in most tasks, across both language pairs, multilingual models fine-tuned on code-switched data perform best, showing that multilingual models can be further optimized for code-switching tasks.","{'sequence': 'Code-switching is the use of more than one language in the same conversation or utterance.

Resources and Evaluation,Learning and Evaluating Emotion Lexicons for 91 Languages,"Emotion lexicons describe the affective meaning of words and thus constitute a centerpiece for advanced sentiment and emotion analysis. Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

Resources and Evaluation,Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation using Source Language Inputs and Cross-lingual Language Model,"We propose an automatic evaluation method of machine translation that uses source language sentences regarded as additional pseudo references. The proposed method evaluates a translation hypothesis in a regression model. The model takes the paired source, reference, and hypothesis sentence all together as an input. A pretrained large scale cross-lingual language model encodes the input to sentence-pair vectors, and the model predicts a human evaluation score with those vectors. Our experiments show that our proposed method using Crosslingual Language Model (XLM) trained with a translation language modeling (TLM) objective achieves a higher correlation with human judgments than a baseline method that uses only hypothesis and reference sentences.

Resources and Evaluation,A Corpus for Large-Scale Phonetic Typology,"A major hurdle in data-driven research on typology is having sufficient data in many languages to draw meaningful conclusions.

Access to such data can greatly facilitate investigation of phonetic typology at a large scale and across many languages. However, it is nontrivial and computationally intensive to obtain such alignments for hundreds of languages, many of which have few to no resources presently available.

Resources and Evaluation,Not All Claims are Created Equal: Choosing the Right Statistical Approach to Assess Hypotheses,"Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues. While alternative proposals have been well-debated and adopted in other fields, they remain rarely discussed or used within the NLP community. We address this gap by contrasting various hypothesis assessment techniques, especially those not commonly used in the field (such as evaluations based on Bayesian inference). Since these statistical techniques differ in the hypotheses they can support, we argue that practitioners should first decide their target hypothesis before choosing an assessment method. This is crucial because common fallacies, misconceptions, and misinterpretation surrounding hypothesis assessment methods often stem from a discrepancy between what one would like to claim versus what the method used actually assesses. Our survey reveals that these issues are omnipresent in the NLP research community. As a step forward, we provide best practices and guidelines tailored towards NLP research, as well as an easy-to-use package called HyBayes for Bayesian assessment of hypotheses, 1 complementing existing tools.","{'sequence': 'Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues.

Resources and Evaluation,Multi-Hypothesis Machine Translation Evaluation,"Reliably evaluating Machine Translation (MT) through automated metrics is a long-standing problem. One of the main challenges is the fact that multiple outputs can be equally valid. Attempts to minimise this issue include metrics that relax the matching of MT output and reference strings, and the use of multiple references. The latter has been shown to significantly improve the performance of evaluation metrics. However, collecting multiple references is expensive and in practice a single reference is generally used. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: instead of modelling linguistic variation in human reference we exploit the MT model uncertainty to generate multiple diverse translations and use these: (i) as surrogates to reference translations; (ii) to obtain a quantification of translation variability to either complement existing metric scores or (iii) replace references altogether.

Our theoretical analysis and experimental results over both synthetic data and data from NLP shared tasks indicate that the proposed metric captures quality aspects from different traditional tasks simultaneously.

Resources and Evaluation,PuzzLing Machines: A Challenge on Learning From Small Data,"Deep neural models have repeatedly proved excellent at memorizing surface patterns from large datasets for various ML and NLP benchmarks. They struggle to achieve human-like thinking, however, because they lack the skill of iterative reasoning upon knowledge. To expose this problem in a new light, we introduce a challenge on learning from small data, PuzzLing Machines, which consists of Rosetta Stone puzzles from Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. These puzzles are carefully designed to contain only the minimal amount of parallel text necessary to deduce the form of unseen expressions. Solving them does not require external information (e.g., knowledge bases, visual signals) or linguistic expertise, but meta-linguistic awareness and deductive skills. Our challenge contains around 100 puzzles covering a wide range of linguistic phenomena from 81 languages. We show that both simple statistical algorithms and state-of-the-art deep neural models perform inadequately on this challenge, as expected. We hope that this benchmark, available at https://ukplab.github.io/ PuzzLing-Machines/, inspires further efforts towards a new paradigm in NLP-one that is grounded in human-like reasoning and understanding.","{'sequence': 'Deep neural models have repeatedly proved excellent at memorizing surface patterns from large datasets for various ML and NLP benchmarks.

Resources and Evaluation,A Recipe for Creating Multimodal Aligned Datasets for Sequential Tasks,"Many high-level procedural tasks can be decomposed into sequences of instructions that vary in their order and choice of tools. In the cooking domain, the web offers many partially-overlapping text and video recipes (i.e. procedures) that describe how to make the same dish (i.e. high-level task). Aligning instructions for the same dish across different sources can yield descriptive visual explanations that are far richer semantically than conventional textual instructions, providing commonsense insight into how real-world procedures are structured. Learning to align these different instruction sets is challenging because: a) different recipes vary in their order of instructions and use of ingredients; and b) video instructions can be noisy and tend to contain far more information than text instructions. To address these challenges, we first use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the same dish. We then use a graph algorithm to derive a joint alignment between multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish. We release the MICROSOFT RESEARCH MUL-TIMODAL ALIGNED RECIPE CORPUS 1 containing ∼150K pairwise alignments between recipes across 4,262 dishes with rich commonsense information. * Work done when the author was an intern at Microsoft. 1 https://github.com/microsoft/ multimodal-aligned-recipe-corpus 7.

Resources and Evaluation,Facet-Aware Evaluation for Extractive Summarization,"Commonly adopted metrics for extractive summarization focus on lexical overlap at the token level. In this paper, we present a facetaware evaluation setup for better assessment of the information coverage in extracted summaries. Specifically, we treat each sentence in the reference summary as a facet, identify the sentences in the document that express the semantics of each facet as support sentences of the facet, and automatically evaluate extractive summarization methods by comparing the indices of extracted sentences and support sentences of all the facets in the reference summary. To facilitate this new evaluation setup, we construct an extractive version of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and perform a thorough quantitative investigation, through which we demonstrate that facet-aware evaluation manifests better correlation with human judgment than ROUGE, enables fine-grained evaluation as well as comparative analysis, and reveals valuable insights of state-of-the-art summarization methods. 1 Reference: Three people in Kansas have died from a listeria outbreak.

Resources and Evaluation,ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations,"In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary. Despite these varied range of possible text alterations, current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation, such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed.","{'sequence': 'In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Non-Linear Instance-Based Cross-Lingual Mapping for Non-Isomorphic Embedding Spaces,"We present INSTAMAP, an instance-based method for learning projection-based crosslingual word embeddings. Unlike prior work, it deviates from learning a single global linear projection.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Moving Down the Long Tail of Word Sense Disambiguation with Gloss Informed Bi-encoders,"A major obstacle in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is that word senses are not uniformly distributed, causing existing models to generally perform poorly on senses that are either rare or unseen during training. We propose a bi-encoder model that independently embeds (1) the target word with its surrounding context and (2) the dictionary definition, or gloss, of each sense. The encoders are jointly optimized in the same representation space, so that sense disambiguation can be performed by finding the nearest sense embedding for each target word embedding. Our system outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on English all-words WSD; these gains predominantly come from improved performance on rare senses, leading to a 31.1% error reduction on less frequent senses over prior work. This demonstrates that rare senses can be more effectively disambiguated by modeling their definitions.","{'sequence': 'A major obstacle in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is that word senses are not uniformly distributed, causing existing models to generally perform poorly on senses that are either rare or unseen during training.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,Adaptive Compression of Word Embeddings,"Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the large memory footprint of word embeddings makes it challenging to deploy NLP models to memory-constrained devices (e.g., selfdriving cars, mobile devices). In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings. We fundamentally follow a code-book approach that represents words as discrete codes such as (8, 5, 2, 4). However, unlike prior works that assign the same length of codes to all words, we adaptively assign different lengths of codes to each word by learning downstream tasks. The proposed method works in two steps. First, each word directly learns to select its code length in an end-to-end manner by applying the Gumbel-softmax tricks. After selecting the code length, each word learns discrete codes through a neural network with a binary constraint. To showcase the general applicability of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance on four different downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly show that our method is effective and makes the highly compressed word embeddings without hurting the task accuracy. Moreover, we show that our model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.","{'sequence': 'Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Our results on selectional preference and WordNet datasets show that the centroid-based model will fail to achieve good enough performance, the geometry of the distribution and the existence of subgroups will have limited impact, and also the negative instances need to be considered for adequate modeling of the distribution. We further investigated the relationship between the scores calculated by each model and the degree of membership and found that discriminative learning-based models are best in finding the boundaries of a class, while models based on the offset between positive and negative instances perform best in determining the degree of membership.","{'sequence': 'This paper presents an investigation on the distribution of word vectors belonging to a certain word class in a pre-trained word vector space.

Semantics: Lexical Semantics,CluBERT: A Cluster-Based Approach for Learning Sense Distributions in Multiple Languages,"Knowing the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) of a word has been proved to help Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) models significantly. However, the scarcity of sense-annotated data makes it difficult to induce a reliable and highcoverage distribution of the meanings in a language vocabulary. To address this issue, in this paper we present CluBERT, an automatic and multilingual approach for inducing the distributions of word senses from a corpus of raw sentences. Our experiments show that Clu-BERT learns distributions over English senses that are of higher quality than those extracted by alternative approaches. When used to induce the MFS of a lemma, CluBERT attains state-of-the-art results on the English Word Sense Disambiguation tasks and helps to improve the disambiguation performance of two off-the-shelf WSD models. Moreover, our distributions also prove to be effective in other languages, beating all their alternatives for computing the MFS on the multilingual WSD tasks. We release our sense distributions in five different languages at https://github. com/SapienzaNLP/clubert.","{'sequence': 'Knowing the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) of a word has been proved to help Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) models significantly.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",LogicalFactChecker: Leveraging Logical Operations for Fact Checking with Graph Module Network,"Verifying the correctness of a textual statement requires not only semantic reasoning about the meaning of words, but also symbolic reasoning about logical operations like count, superlative, aggregation, etc. In this work, we propose LogicalFactChecker, a neural network approach capable of leveraging logical operations for fact checking. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on TABFACT, a large-scale, benchmark dataset built for verifying a textual statement with semi-structured tables. This is achieved by a graph module network built upon the Transformer-based architecture. With a textual statement and a table as the input, LogicalFactChecker automatically derives a program (a.k.a. logical form) of the statement in a semantic parsing manner. A heterogeneous graph is then constructed to capture not only the structures of the table and the program, but also the connections between inputs with different modalities. Such a graph reveals the related contexts of each word in the statement, the table and the program. The graph is used to obtain graphenhanced contextual representations of words in Transformer-based architecture. After that, a program-driven module network is further introduced to exploit the hierarchical structure of the program, where semantic compositionality is dynamically modeled along the program structure with a set of function-specific modules. Ablation experiments suggest that both the heterogeneous graph and the module network are important to obtain strong results.","{'sequence': 'Verifying the correctness of a textual statement requires not only semantic reasoning about the meaning of words, but also symbolic reasoning about logical operations like count, superlative, aggregation, etc. In this work, we propose LogicalFactChecker, a neural network approach capable of leveraging logical operations for fact checking.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Parsing into Variable-in-situ Logico-Semantic Graphs,"We propose variable-in-situ logico-semantic graphs to bridge the gap between semantic graph and logical form parsing. The new type of graph-based meaning representation allows us to include analysis for scope-related phenomena, such as quantification, negation and modality, in a way that is consistent with the state-of-the-art underspecification approach. Moreover, the well-formedness of such a graph is clear, since model-theoretic interpretation is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective by developing a new state-of-the-art semantic parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics. At the core of this parser is a novel neural graph rewriting system which combines the strengths of Hyperedge Replacement Grammar, a knowledgeintensive model, and Graph Neural Networks, a data-intensive model. Our parser achieves an accuracy of 92.39% in terms of ELEMENTARY DEPENDENCY MATCH, which is a 2.88 point improvement over the best data-driven model in the literature. The output of our parser is highly coherent: at least 91% graphs are valid, in that they allow at least one sound scoperesolved logical form.","{'sequence': 'We propose variable-in-situ logico-semantic graphs to bridge the gap between semantic graph and logical form parsing.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization,"Adversarial attacks are carried out to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks. Textual adversarial attacking is challenging because text is discrete and a small perturbation can bring significant change to the original input. Word-level attacking, which can be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem, is a well-studied class of textual attack methods. However, existing word-level attack models are far from perfect, largely because unsuitable search space reduction methods and inefficient optimization algorithms are employed. In this paper, we propose a novel attack model, which incorporates the sememebased word substitution method and particle swarm optimization-based search algorithm to solve the two problems separately. We conduct exhaustive experiments to evaluate our attack model by attacking BiLSTM and BERT on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves much higher attack success rates and crafts more high-quality adversarial examples as compared to baseline methods. Also, further experiments show our model has higher transferability and can bring more robustness enhancement to victim models by adversarial training.

XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing perlanguage performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",TaPas: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training,"Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task. To alleviate the collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition, the generated logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving the denotation. In this paper, we present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT's architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia, and is trained end-to-end. We experiment with three different semantic parsing datasets, and find that TAPAS outperforms or rivals semantic parsing models by improving state-of-the-art accuracy on SQA from 55.1 to 67.2 and performing on par with the state-of-the-art on WIKISQL and WIKITQ, but with a simpler model architecture.

We additionally find that transfer learning, which is trivial in our setting, from WIK-ISQL to WIKITQ, yields 48.7 accuracy, 4.2 points above the state-of-the-art."", 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theme', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.3527382016181946, 0.057525262236595154, 0.04487263783812523, 0.03720121458172798, 0.03659561276435852, 0.034966759383678436, 0.034708622843027115, 0.031941238790750504, 0.031086362898349762, 0.030925557017326355, 0.028137505054473877, 0.02804827317595482, 0.026196304708719254, 0.025054512545466423, 0.02412932738661766, 0.02361169084906578, 0.020446473732590675, 0.020065708085894585, 0.019619185477495193, 0.019443824887275696, 0.018140321597456932, 0.0177981685847044, 0.014837149530649185, 0.010644813068211079, 0.007595767267048359, 0.0036694600712507963]}",0.3527382016181946,Question Answering,0.030925557017326355

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Do Neural Models Learn Systematicity of Monotonicity Inference in Natural Language?,"Despite the success of language models using neural networks, it remains unclear to what extent neural models have the generalization ability to perform inferences. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating whether neural models can learn systematicity of monotonicity inference in natural language, namely, the regularity for performing arbitrary inferences with generalization on composition. We consider four aspects of monotonicity inferences and test whether the models can systematically interpret lexical and logical phenomena on different training/test splits. A series of experiments show that three neural models systematically draw inferences on unseen combinations of lexical and logical phenomena when the syntactic structures of the sentences are similar between the training and test sets. However, the performance of the models significantly decreases when the structures are slightly changed in the test set while retaining all vocabularies and constituents already appearing in the training set. This indicates that the generalization ability of neural models is limited to cases where the syntactic structures are nearly the same as those in the training set. (1) P : Some [puppies ↑] ran.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Generating Fact Checking Explanations,"Most existing work on automated fact checking is concerned with predicting the veracity of claims based on metadata, social network spread, language used in claims, and, more recently, evidence supporting or denying claims. A crucial piece of the puzzle that is still missing is to understand how to automate the most elaborate part of the process -generating justifications for verdicts on claims. This paper provides the first study of how these explanations can be generated automatically based on available claim context, and how this task can be modelled jointly with veracity prediction. Our results indicate that optimising both objectives at the same time, rather than training them separately, improves the performance of a fact checking system. The results of a manual evaluation further suggest that the informativeness, coverage and overall quality of the generated explanations are also improved in the multi-task model.

The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. (...)

Scientists have proven that spills far smaller than Santa Barbara's have been devastating. Justification: While the nation's largest oil well blowout did take place in 1969, it's not factually correct to call it the ""last major oil spill"". First of all, two of the largest blowouts in the world took place in the U. S. the following year.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Towards Robustifying NLI Models Against Lexical Dataset Biases,"While deep learning models are making fast progress on the task of Natural Language Inference, recent studies have also shown that these models achieve high accuracy by exploiting several dataset biases, and without deep understanding of the language semantics. Using contradiction-word bias and word-overlapping bias as our two bias examples, this paper explores both data-level and model-level debiasing methods to robustify models against lexical dataset biases. First, we debias the dataset through data augmentation and enhancement, but show that the model bias cannot be fully removed via this method. Next, we also compare two ways of directly debiasing the model without knowing what the dataset biases are in advance. The first approach aims to remove the label bias at the embedding level. The second approach employs a bag-of-words submodel to capture the features that are likely to exploit the bias and prevents the original model from learning these biased features by forcing orthogonality between these two submodels. We performed evaluations on new balanced datasets extracted from the original MNLI dataset as well as the NLI stress tests, and show that the orthogonality approach is better at debiasing the model while maintaining competitive overall accuracy. 1","{'sequence': 'While deep learning models are making fast progress on the task of Natural Language Inference, recent studies have also shown that these models achieve high accuracy by exploiting several dataset biases, and without deep understanding of the language semantics.

Such generated natural language (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they should correlate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, we focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the following question: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy, while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We propose Naturallanguage Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLI method which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to produce labels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectiveness over previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of the produced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports the claim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of their decisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanations in terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations.

Our best models approach human performance, demonstrating models may be capable of more subtle inferences than the categorical bin assignment employed in current NLI tasks.', 'labels': ['System Demonstrations', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Theme', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Question Answering', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09816348552703857, 0.08834780007600784, 0.06662853807210922, 0.06629399955272675, 0.055728357285261154, 0.054963987320661545, 0.0516187809407711, 0.04716826230287552, 0.04201886057853699, 0.035462528467178345, 0.03430843725800514, 0.0340125672519207, 0.0329846553504467, 0.030542263761162758, 0.02983388677239418, 0.027957087382674217, 0.02786112204194069, 0.02761569432914257, 0.025576017796993256, 0.023943109437823296, 0.020508430898189545, 0.019926661625504494, 0.019876589998602867, 0.01454781275242567, 0.01237745862454176, 0.01173367165029049]}",0.09816348552703857,System Demonstrations,0.02786112204194069
"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",INFOTABS: Inference on Tables as Semi-structured Data,"In this paper, we observe that semi-structured tabulated text is ubiquitous; understanding them requires not only comprehending the meaning of text fragments, but also implicit relationships between them. We argue that such data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about information. To study this, we introduce a new dataset called INFOTABS, comprising of human-written textual hypotheses based on premises that are tables extracted from Wikipedia info-boxes. Our analysis shows that the semi-structured, multi-domain and heterogeneous nature of the premises admits complex, multi-faceted reasoning.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Evidence-Aware Inferential Text Generation with Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder,"Generating inferential texts about an event in different perspectives requires reasoning over different contexts that the event occurs. Existing works usually ignore the context that is not explicitly provided, resulting in a context-independent semantic representation that struggles to support the generation. To address this, we propose an approach that automatically finds evidence for an event from a large text corpus, and leverages the evidence to guide the generation of inferential texts. Our approach works in an encoderdecoder manner and is equipped with a Vector Quantised-Variational Autoencoder, where the encoder outputs representations from a distribution over discrete variables. Such discrete representations enable automatically selecting relevant evidence, which not only facilitates evidence-aware generation, but also provides a natural way to uncover rationales behind the generation.

This seemingly inevitable trade-off may not tell us much about the changes in the reasoning and understanding capabilities of the resulting models on broader types of examples beyond the small subset represented in the outof-distribution data. In this paper, we address this trade-off by introducing a novel debiasing method, called confidence regularization, which discourage models from exploiting biases while enabling them to receive enough incentive to learn from all the training examples.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Out of the Echo Chamber: Detecting Countering Debate Speeches,"An educated and informed consumption of media content has become a challenge in modern times. With the shift from traditional news outlets to social media and similar venues, a major concern is that readers are becoming encapsulated in ""echo chambers"" and may fall prey to fake news and disinformation, lacking easy access to dissenting views. We suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns -that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments -and not just the stance -made in a given text. We study this problem in the context of debate speeches. Given such a speech, we aim to identify, from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance, the ones that directly counter it. We provide a large dataset of 3685 such speeches (in English), annotated for this relation, which hopefully would be of general interest to the NLP community. We explore several algorithms addressing this task, and while some are successful, all fall short of expert human performance, suggesting room for further research.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","ECPE-2D: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction based on Joint Two-Dimensional Representation, Interaction and Prediction","In recent years, a new interesting task, called emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis. It aims at extracting the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. To solve this task, the existing research employed a two-step framework, which first extracts individual emotion set and cause set, and then pair the corresponding emotions and causes. However, such a pipeline of two steps contains some inherent flaws: 1) the modeling does not aim at extracting the final emotion-cause pair directly; 2) the errors from the first step will affect the performance of the second step. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a new end-toend approach, called ECPE-Two-Dimensional (ECPE-2D), to represent the emotion-cause pairs by a 2D representation scheme. A 2D transformer module and two variants, windowconstrained and cross-road 2D transformers, are further proposed to model the interactions of different emotion-cause pairs. The 2D representation, interaction, and prediction are integrated into a joint framework. In addition to the advantages of joint modeling, the experimental results on the benchmark emotion cause corpus show that our approach improves the F1 score of the state-of-the-art from 61.28% to 68.89%.","{'sequence': 'In recent years, a new interesting task, called emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Cross-Lingual Unsupervised Sentiment Classification with Multi-View Transfer Learning,"Recent neural network models have achieved impressive performance on sentiment classification in English as well as other languages. Their success heavily depends on the availability of a large amount of labeled data or parallel corpus. In this paper, we investigate an extreme scenario of cross-lingual sentiment classification, in which the low-resource language does not have any labels or parallel corpus. We propose an unsupervised cross-lingual sentiment classification model named multi-view encoder-classifier (MVEC) that leverages an unsupervised machine translation (UMT) system and a language discriminator. Unlike previous language model (LM) based fine-tuning approaches that adjust parameters solely based on the classification error on training data, we employ the encoder-decoder framework of a UMT as a regularization component on the shared network parameters. In particular, the cross-lingual encoder of our model learns a shared representation, which is effective for both reconstructing input sentences of two languages and generating more representative views from the input for classification. Extensive experiments on five language pairs verify that our model significantly outperforms other models for 8/11 sentiment classification tasks.","{'sequence': 'Recent neural network models have achieved impressive performance on sentiment classification in English as well as other languages.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Modelling Context and Syntactical Features for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) consists of two conceptual tasks, namely an aspect extraction and an aspect sentiment classification. Rather than considering the tasks separately, we build an end-to-end ABSA solution. Previous works in ABSA tasks did not fully leverage the importance of syntactical information. Hence, the aspect extraction model often failed to detect the boundaries of multi-word aspect terms. On the other hand, the aspect sentiment classifier was unable to account for the syntactical correlation between aspect terms and the context words. This paper explores the grammatical aspect of the sentence and employs the self-attention mechanism for syntactical learning. We combine part-of-speech embeddings, dependencybased embeddings and contextualized embeddings (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to enhance the performance of the aspect extractor. We also propose the syntactic relative distance to de-emphasize the adverse effects of unrelated words, having weak syntactic connection with the aspect terms. This increases the accuracy of the aspect sentiment classifier.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Effective Inter-Clause Modeling for End-to-End Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction,"Emotion-cause pair extraction aims to extract all emotion clauses coupled with their cause clauses from a given document. Previous work employs two-step approaches, in which the first step extracts emotion clauses and cause clauses separately, and the second step trains a classifier to filter out negative pairs. However, such pipeline-style system for emotion-cause pair extraction is suboptimal because it suffers from error propagation and the two steps may not adapt to each other well. In this paper, we tackle emotion-cause pair extraction from a ranking perspective, i.e., ranking clause pair candidates in a document, and propose a onestep neural approach which emphasizes interclause modeling to perform end-to-end extraction. It models the interrelations between the clauses in a document to learn clause representations with graph attention, and enhances clause pair representations with kernel-based relative position embedding for effective ranking.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Agreement Prediction of Arguments in Cyber Argumentation for Detecting Stance Polarity and Intensity,"In online debates, users express different levels of agreement/disagreement with one another's arguments and ideas. Often levels of agreement/disagreement are implicit in the text and must be predicted to analyze collective opinions. Existing stance detection methods predict the polarity of a post's stance toward a topic or post, but don't consider the stance's degree of intensity. We introduce a new research problem, stance polarity and intensity prediction in response relationships between posts. This problem is challenging because differences in stance intensity are often subtle and require nuanced language understanding. Cyber argumentation research has shown that incorporating both stance polarity and intensity data in online debates leads to better discussion analysis. We explore five different learning models: Ridge-M regression, Ridge-S regression, SVR-RF-R, pkudblab-PIP, and T-PAN-PIP for predicting stance polarity and intensity in argumentation. These models are evaluated using a new dataset for stance polarity and intensity prediction collected using a cyber argumentation platform. The SVR-RF-R model performs best for prediction of stance polarity with an accuracy of 70.43% and intensity with RMSE of 0.596.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation,"In argumentation, people state premises to reason towards a conclusion. The conclusion conveys a stance towards some target, such as a concept or statement. Often, the conclusion remains implicit, though, since it is self-evident in a discussion or left out for rhetorical reasons. However, the conclusion is key to understanding an argument, and hence, to any application that processes argumentation. We thus study the question to what extent an argument's conclusion can be reconstructed from its premises. In particular, we argue here that a decisive step is to infer a conclusion's target, and we hypothesize that this target is related to the premises' targets. We develop two complementary target inference approaches: one ranks premise targets and selects the top-ranked target as the conclusion target, the other finds a new conclusion target in a learned embedding space using a triplet neural network. Our evaluation on corpora from two domains indicates that a hybrid of both approaches is best, outperforming several strong baselines. According to human annotators, we infer a reasonably adequate conclusion target in 89% of the cases.","{'sequence': ""In argumentation, people state premises to reason towards a conclusion.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Conditional Augmentation for Aspect Term Extraction via Masked Sequence-to-Sequence Generation,"Aspect term extraction aims to extract aspect terms from review texts as opinion targets for sentiment analysis. One of the big challenges with this task is the lack of sufficient annotated data. While data augmentation is potentially an effective technique to address the above issue, it is uncontrollable as it may change aspect words and aspect labels unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels. We propose a masked sequence-to-sequence method for conditional augmentation of aspect term extraction. Unlike existing augmentation approaches, ours is controllable and allows us to generate more diversified sentences. Experimental results confirm that our method alleviates the data scarcity problem significantly. It also effectively boosts the performances of several current models for aspect term extraction.","{'sequence': 'Aspect term extraction aims to extract aspect terms from review texts as opinion targets for sentiment analysis.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Enhancing Cross-target Stance Detection with Transferable Semantic-Emotion Knowledge,"Stance detection is an important task, which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target. Remarkable success has been achieved when sufficient labeled training data is available. However, annotating sufficient data is labor-intensive, which establishes significant barriers for generalizing the stance classifier to the data with new targets. In this paper, we proposed a Semantic-Emotion Knowledge Transferring (SEKT) model for cross-target stance detection, which uses the external knowledge (semantic and emotion lexicons) as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer across different targets. Specifically, a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons, which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. Then, the learned semantic-emotion graph representation, which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains, is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledgeaware memory unit to the BiLSTM cell. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of SEKT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.","{'sequence': 'Stance detection is an important task, which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target.

Further, we observe that the emotions evoked by an event are often related: an event that evokes joy is unlikely to also evoke sadness. In this work, we explicitly model label classes via label embeddings, and add mechanisms that track label-label correlations both during training and inference.

A Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis","In this paper, we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion, and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario. We, at first, manually annotate the recently released multi-modal MUStARD sarcasm dataset with sentiment and emotion classes, both implicit and explicit. For multitasking, we propose two attention mechanisms, viz. Inter-segment Inter-modal Attention (I e -Attention) and Intra-segment Inter-modal Attention (I a -Attention). The main motivation of I e -Attention is to learn the relationship between the different segments of the sentence across the modalities. In contrast, I a -Attention focuses within the same segment of the sentence across the modalities. Finally, representations from both the attentions are concatenated and shared across the five classes (i.e., sarcasm, implicit sentiment, explicit sentiment, implicit emotion, explicit emotion) for multi-tasking. Experimental results on the extended version of the MUStARD dataset show the efficacy of our proposed approach for sarcasm detection over the existing state-of-theart systems. The evaluation also shows that the proposed multi-task framework yields better performance for the primary task, i.e., sarcasm detection, with the help of two secondary tasks, emotion and sentiment analysis.","{'sequence': 'In this paper, we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion, and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario.

Speech and Multimodality,Meta-Transfer Learning for Code-Switched Speech Recognition,"An increasing number of people in the world today speak a mixed-language as a result of being multilingual. However, building a speech recognition system for code-switching remains difficult due to the availability of limited resources and the expense and significant effort required to collect mixed-language data. We therefore propose a new learning method, meta-transfer learning, to transfer learn on a code-switched speech recognition system in a low-resource setting by judiciously extracting information from high-resource monolingual datasets. Our model learns to recognize individual languages, and transfer them so as to better recognize mixed-language speech by conditioning the optimization on the codeswitching data.

Speech and Multimodality,How Accents Confound: Probing for Accent Information in End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,"In this work, we present a detailed analysis of how accent information is reflected in the internal representation of speech in an end-toend automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. We use a state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR system, comprising convolutional and recurrent layers, that is trained on a large amount of US-accented English speech and evaluate the model on speech samples from seven different English accents. We examine the effects of accent on the internal representation using three main probing techniques: a) Gradient-based explanation methods, b) Information-theoretic measures, and c) Outputs of accent and phone classifiers. We find different accents exhibiting similar trends irrespective of the probing technique used. We also find that most accent information is encoded within the first recurrent layer, which is suggestive of how one could adapt such an end-to-end model to learn representations that are invariant to accents.","{'sequence': 'In this work, we present a detailed analysis of how accent information is reflected in the internal representation of speech in an end-toend automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.

Speech and Multimodality,Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers,"Recent Transformer-based contextual word representations, including BERT and XLNet, have shown state-of-the-art performance in multiple disciplines within NLP. Fine-tuning the trained contextual models on task-specific datasets has been the key to achieving superior performance downstream. While finetuning these pre-trained models is straightforward for lexical applications (applications with only language modality), it is not trivial for multimodal language (a growing area in NLP focused on modeling face-to-face communication). Pre-trained models don't have the necessary components to accept two extra modalities of vision and acoustic. In this paper, we proposed an attachment to BERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). MAG allows BERT and XL-Net to accept multimodal nonverbal data during fine-tuning. It does so by generating a shift to internal representation of BERT and XLNet; a shift that is conditioned on the visual and acoustic modalities. In our experiments, we study the commonly used CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet significantly boosts the sentiment analysis performance over previous baselines as well as language-only finetuning of BERT and XLNet.

Speech and Multimodality,Reasoning with Multimodal Sarcastic Tweets via Modeling Cross-Modality Contrast and Semantic Association,"Sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon to express the opposite of what one really means.

Our method models both cross-modality contrast and semantic association by constructing the Decomposition and Relation Network (namely D&R Net).

Speech and Multimodality,Towards Emotion-aided Multi-modal Dialogue Act Classification,"The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively. But these studies limit themselves to text. Non-verbal features (change of tone, facial expressions etc.) can provide cues to identify DAs, thus stressing the benefit of incorporating multi-modal inputs in the task. Also, the emotional state of the speaker has a substantial effect on the choice of the dialogue act, since conversations are often influenced by emotions. Hence, the effect of emotion too on automatic identification of DAs needs to be studied. In this work, we address the role of both multi-modality and emotion recognition (ER) in DAC. DAC and ER help each other by way of multi-task learning. One of the major contributions of this work is a new dataset-multimodal Emotion aware Dialogue Act dataset called EMOTyDA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. To demonstrate the utility of EMOTyDA, we build an attention based (self, inter-modal, inter-task) multi-modal, multi-task Deep Neural Network (DNN) for joint learning of DAs and emotions. We show empirically that multimodality and multi-tasking achieve better performance of DAC compared to uni-modal and single task DAC variants. amounting to a total of 13708 utterances across the dataset. Each utterance is annotated for the presence of 7 emotions namely sadness, anger, fear, joy, surprise, disgust, and neutral.","{'sequence': 'The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively.

Additionally, we incorporate a multitask training criterion for multiresolution ASR, where we train the model to generate both character and subword level transcriptions. Experimental results on the How2 dataset, indicate that multiresolution training can speed up convergence by around 50% and relatively improves word error rate (WER) performance by upto 18% over subword prediction models.

Speech and Multimodality,Acoustic-Prosodic and Lexical Cues to Deception and Trust: Deciphering How People Detect Lies,"Humans rarely perform better than chance at lie detection. To better understand human perception of deception, we created a game framework, LieCatcher, to collect ratings of perceived deception using a large corpus of deceptive and truthful interviews. We analyzed the acoustic-prosodic and linguistic characteristics of language trusted and mistrusted by raters and compared these to characteristics of actual truthful and deceptive language to understand how perception aligns with reality. With this data we built classifiers to automatically distinguish trusted from mistrusted speech, achieving an F1 of 66.1%. We next evaluated whether the strategies raters said they used to discriminate between truthful and deceptive responses were in fact useful. Our results show that, although several prosodic and lexical features were consistently perceived as trustworthy, they were not reliable cues. Also, the strategies that judges reported using in deception detection were not helpful for the task. Our work sheds light on the nature of trusted language and provides insight into the challenging problem of human deception detection.","{'sequence': 'Humans rarely perform better than chance at lie detection.

Speech and Multimodality,CH-SIMS: A Chinese Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Dataset with Fine-grained Annotation of Modality,"Previous studies in multimodal sentiment analysis have used limited datasets, which only contain unified multimodal annotations. However, the unified annotations do not always reflect the independent sentiment of single modalities and limit the model to capture the difference between modalities. In this paper, we introduce a Chinese single-and multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, CH-SIMS, which contains 2,281 refined video segments in the wild with both multimodal and independent unimodal annotations. It allows researchers to study the interaction between modalities or use independent unimodal annotations for unimodal sentiment analysis.

Speech and Multimodality,Learning Spoken Language Representations with Neural Lattice Language Modeling,"Pre-trained language models have achieved huge improvement on many NLP tasks. However, these methods are usually designed for written text, so they do not consider the properties of spoken language. Therefore, this paper aims at generalizing the idea of language model pre-training to lattices generated by recognition systems. We propose a framework that trains neural lattice language models to provide contextualized representations for spoken language understanding tasks. The proposed two-stage pre-training approach reduces the demands of speech data and has better efficiency. Experiments on intent detection and dialogue act recognition datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms strong baselines when evaluated on spoken inputs. 1","{'sequence': 'Pre-trained language models have achieved huge improvement on many NLP tasks.

Speech and Multimodality,Improved Speech Representations with Multi-Target Autoregressive Predictive Coding,"Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech. One example is Autoregressive Predictive Coding (Chung et al., 2019) , which trains an autoregressive RNN to generate an unseen future frame given a context such as recent past frames. The basic hypothesis of these approaches is that hidden states that can accurately predict future frames are a useful representation for many downstream tasks. In this paper we extend this hypothesis and aim to enrich the information encoded in the hidden states by training the model to make more accurate future predictions. We propose an auxiliary objective that serves as a regularization to improve generalization of the future frame prediction task. Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content.","{'sequence': 'Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech.

Summarization,Hooks in the Headline: Learning to Generate Headlines with Controlled Styles,"Current summarization systems only produce plain, factual headlines, but do not meet the practical needs of creating memorable titles to increase exposure. We propose a new task, Stylistic Headline Generation (SHG), to enrich the headlines with three style options (humor, romance and clickbait), in order to attract more readers.

Summarization,Knowledge Graph-Augmented Abstractive Summarization with Semantic-Driven Cloze Reward,"Sequence-to-sequence models for abstractive summarization have been studied extensively, yet the generated summaries commonly suffer from fabricated content, and are often found to be near-extractive. We argue that, to address these issues, the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, e.g., via structured representation, to allow the generation of more informative summaries. In this paper, we present ASGARD, a novel framework for Abstractive Summarization with Graph-Augmentation and semantic-driven RewarD. We propose the use of dual encoders-a sequential document encoder and a graphstructured encoder-to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities, complementing each other. We further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. Results show that our models produce significantly higher ROUGE scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both New York Times and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. We also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are finetuned from large pretrained language models. Human judges further rate our model outputs as more informative and containing fewer unfaithful errors. Input Article of New York Times: John M. Fabrizi, the mayor of Bridgeport, admitted on Tuesday that he had used cocaine and abused alcohol while in office. Mr. Fabrizi, who was appointed mayor in 2003 after the former mayor, Joseph P.

Summarization,Screenplay Summarization Using Latent Narrative Structure,"Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront. As a result, such models are biased by position and often perform a smart selection of sentences from the beginning of the document. When summarizing long narratives, which have complex structure and present information piecemeal, simple position heuristics are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose to explicitly incorporate the underlying structure of narratives into general unsupervised and supervised extractive summarization models. We formalize narrative structure in terms of key narrative events (turning points) and treat it as latent in order to summarize screenplays (i.e., extract an optimal sequence of scenes). Experimental results on the CSI corpus of TV screenplays, which we augment with scene-level summarization labels, show that latent turning points correlate with important aspects of a CSI episode and improve summarization performance over general extractive algorithms, leading to more complete and diverse summaries.","{'sequence': 'Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront.

Summarization,Jointly Learning to Align and Summarize for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization,"Cross-lingual summarization is the task of generating a summary in one language given a text in a different language. Previous works on cross-lingual summarization mainly focus on using pipeline methods or training an endto-end model using the translated parallel data. However, it is a big challenge for the model to directly learn cross-lingual summarization as it requires learning to understand different languages and learning how to summarize at the same time. In this paper, we propose to ease the cross-lingual summarization training by jointly learning to align and summarize. We design relevant loss functions to train this framework and propose several methods to enhance the isomorphism and cross-lingual transfer between languages.

However, existing models are not optimized for factual correctness, a critical metric in real-world applications. In this work, we develop a general framework where we evaluate the factual correctness of a generated summary by factchecking it automatically against its reference using an information extraction module. We further propose a training strategy which optimizes a neural summarization model with a factual correctness reward via reinforcement learning. We apply the proposed method to the summarization of radiology reports, where factual correctness is a key requirement.

A novel unsupervised training procedure leverages this coverage model along with a fluency model to generate and score summaries. When tested on popular news summarization datasets, the method outperforms previous unsupervised methods by more than 2 R-1 points, and approaches results of competitive supervised methods.

Summarization,Discrete Optimization for Unsupervised Sentence Summarization with Word-Level Extraction,"Automatic sentence summarization produces a shorter version of a sentence, while preserving its most important information.

Our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the art for unsupervised sentence summarization according to ROUGE scores.

Since this is unwillingly exploited in recent work, we emphasize that future evaluation should explicitly group summarization systems by output length brackets. 1', 'labels': ['Summarization', 'System Demonstrations', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Theme', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'NLP Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Question Answering', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.16166722774505615, 0.06253991276025772, 0.059933919459581375, 0.05765530839562416, 0.055195409804582596, 0.054906729608774185, 0.0537482351064682, 0.041001539677381516, 0.037229083478450775, 0.03337901830673218, 0.03326673060655594, 0.033022817224264145, 0.03285284340381622, 0.030719058588147163, 0.02799415774643421, 0.02732779085636139, 0.02652626484632492, 0.026374300941824913, 0.024870771914720535, 0.023076290264725685, 0.0214610043913126, 0.01859149895608425, 0.018507085740566254, 0.01725919172167778, 0.011205070652067661, 0.009688745252788067]}",0.16166722774505615,Summarization,0.16166722774505615
Summarization,Extractive Summarization as Text Matching,"This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems. Instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably, this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset. Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework. We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To encourage more instantiations in the future, we have released our codes, processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in https://github. com/maszhongming/MatchSum.","{'sequence': 'This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems.

Summarization,Self-Attention Guided Copy Mechanism for Abstractive Summarization,"Copy module has been widely equipped in the recent abstractive summarization models, which facilitates the decoder to extract words from the source into the summary. Generally, the encoder-decoder attention is served as the copy distribution, while how to guarantee that important words in the source are copied remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based model to enhance the copy mechanism. Specifically, we identify the importance of each source word based on the degree centrality with a directed graph built by the self-attention layer in the Transformer. We use the centrality of each source word to guide the copy process explicitly. Experimental results show that the self-attention graph provides useful guidance for the copy distribution. Our proposed models significantly outperform the baseline methods on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and the Gigaword dataset.","{'sequence': 'Copy module has been widely equipped in the recent abstractive summarization models, which facilitates the decoder to extract words from the source into the summary.

Summarization,Improving Truthfulness of Headline Generation,"Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries. However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of generated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in the source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline generation on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the stateof-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes generates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in untruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify the truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment of whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing untruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the untruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out untruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results demonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision data shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in automatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines.","{'sequence': 'Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries.

Summarization,Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual Consistency of Summaries,"Practical applications of abstractive summarization models are limited by frequent factual inconsistencies with respect to their input. Existing automatic evaluation metrics for summarization are largely insensitive to such errors. We propose QAGS, 1 an automatic evaluation protocol that is designed to identify factual inconsistencies in a generated summary. QAGS is based on the intuition that if we ask questions about a summary and its source, we will receive similar answers if the summary is factually consistent with the source. To evaluate QAGS, we collect human judgments of factual consistency on model-generated summaries for the CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) summarization datasets. QAGS has substantially higher correlations with these judgments than other automatic evaluation metrics. Also, QAGS offers a natural form of interpretability: The answers and questions generated while computing QAGS indicate which tokens of a summary are inconsistent and why. We believe QAGS is a promising tool in automatically generating usable and factually consistent text.

Summarization,"Attend, Translate and Summarize: An Efficient Method for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization","Cross-lingual summarization aims at summarizing a document in one language (e.g., Chinese) into another language (e.g., English). In this paper, we propose a novel method inspired by the translation pattern in the process of obtaining a cross-lingual summary. We first attend to some words in the source text, then translate them into the target language, and summarize to get the final summary. Specifically, we first employ the encoder-decoder attention distribution to attend to the source words. Second, we present three strategies to acquire the translation probability, which helps obtain the translation candidates for each source word. Finally, each summary word is generated either from the neural distribution or from the translation candidates of source words. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese summarization tasks have shown that our proposed method can significantly outperform the baselines, achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.","{'sequence': 'Cross-lingual summarization aims at summarizing a document in one language (e.g., Chinese) into another language (e.g., English).

Summarization,On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization,"It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria. 1 * The first two authors contributed equally. 1 Our human annotated summaries for faithfulness and factuality will be released at https://github.com/google-researchdatasets/xsum hallucination annotations.","{'sequence': 'It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation.

Summarization,Unsupervised Opinion Summarization as Copycat-Review Generation,"Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews. While the majority of previous work has focused on the extractive setting, i.e., selecting fragments from input reviews to produce a summary, we let the model generate novel sentences and hence produce abstractive summaries. Recent progress in summarization has seen the development of supervised models which rely on large quantities of document-summary pairs. Since such training data is expensive to acquire, we instead consider the unsupervised setting, in other words, we do not use any summaries in training. We define a generative model for a review collection which capitalizes on the intuition that when generating a new review given a set of other reviews of a product, we should be able to control the ""amount of novelty"" going into the new review or, equivalently, vary the extent to which it deviates from the input. At test time, when generating summaries, we force the novelty to be minimal, and produce a text reflecting consensus opinions. We capture this intuition by defining a hierarchical variational autoencoder model. Both individual reviews and the products they correspond to are associated with stochastic latent codes, and the review generator (""decoder"") has direct access to the text of input reviews through the pointergenerator mechanism. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp datasets, show that setting at test time the review's latent code to its mean, allows the model to produce fluent and coherent summaries reflecting common opinions.","{'sequence': 'Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews.

In this study, we aim to investigate the extent to which the semblance of syntactic structure captured by language models adheres to a surface-syntactic or deep syntactic style of analysis, and whether the patterns are consistent across different languages. We apply a probe for extracting directed dependency trees to BERT and ELMo models trained on 13 different languages, probing for two different syntactic annotation styles: Universal Dependencies (UD), prioritizing deep syntactic relations, and Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD), focusing on surface structure. We find that both models exhibit a preference for UD over SUD -with interesting variations across languages and layers -and that the strength of this preference is correlated with differences in tree shape.","{'sequence': 'Recent work on the interpretability of deep neural language models has concluded that many properties of natural language syntax are encoded in their representational spaces.

We apply a probe for extracting directed dependency trees to BERT and ELMo models trained on 13 different languages, probing for two different syntactic annotation styles: Universal Dependencies (UD), prioritizing deep syntactic relations, and Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD), focusing on surface structure. We find that both models exhibit a preference for UD over SUD -with interesting variations across languages and layers -and that the strength of this preference is correlated with differences in tree shape.', 'labels': ['Question Answering', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Theme', 'Generation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.07119879126548767, 0.06343946605920792, 0.06182447448372841, 0.057673051953315735, 0.055638786405324936, 0.05215408653020859, 0.046486761420965195, 0.04446089267730713, 0.04385699704289436, 0.04044266417622566, 0.04005526751279831, 0.03880393132567406, 0.03690381348133087, 0.036861591041088104, 0.036295413970947266, 0.03618346527218819, 0.03141452372074127, 0.0308257807046175, 0.02993123047053814, 0.0269781406968832, 0.02679804153740406, 0.022103119641542435, 0.019590964540839195, 0.019084149971604347, 0.01764158345758915, 0.01335307490080595]}",0.07119879126548767,Question Answering,0.055638786405324936

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",Efficient Second-Order TreeCRF for Neural Dependency Parsing,"In the deep learning (DL) era, parsing models are extremely simplified with little hurt on performance, thanks to the remarkable capability of multi-layer BiLSTMs in context representation. As the most popular graphbased dependency parser due to its high efficiency and performance, the biaffine parser directly scores single dependencies under the arc-factorization assumption, and adopts a very simple local token-wise cross-entropy training loss. This paper for the first time presents a second-order TreeCRF extension to the biaffine parser. For a long time, the complexity and inefficiency of the inside-outside algorithm hinder the popularity of TreeCRF. To address this issue, we propose an effective way to batchify the inside and Viterbi algorithms for direct large matrix operation on GPUs, and to avoid the complex outside algorithm via efficient back-propagation. Experiments and analysis on 27 datasets from 13 languages clearly show that techniques developed before the DL era, such as structural learning (global TreeCRF loss) and high-order modeling are still useful, and can further boost parsing performance over the state-of-the-art biaffine parser, especially for partially annotated training data.

Experimental results on the MWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus and on six non-English dependency treebanks with frequent flat structures show that: (1) tagging is more accurate than parsing for identifying flat-structure MWEs, (2) our joint decoder reconciles the two different views and, for non-BERT features, leads to higher accuracies, and (3) most of the gains result from feature sharing between the parsers and taggers.', 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'System Demonstrations', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'NLP Applications', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Generation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Theme'], 'scores': [0.07393411546945572, 0.06454528868198395, 0.057551413774490356, 0.05668642744421959, 0.05521468073129654, 0.055046189576387405, 0.044829729944467545, 0.04437845200300217, 0.04396630451083183, 0.04266728088259697, 0.041093721985816956, 0.03678475692868233, 0.03545114025473595, 0.03525204211473465, 0.03484814614057541, 0.034366805106401443, 0.033200059086084366, 0.03260136395692825, 0.02718830108642578, 0.024980325251817703, 0.023126080632209778, 0.021621543914079666, 0.021161984652280807, 0.020930113270878792, 0.01969965174794197, 0.018874039873480797]}",0.07393411546945572,Information Extraction,0.05668642744421959
"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",SeqVAT: Virtual Adversarial Training for Semi-Supervised Sequence Labeling,"Virtual adversarial training (VAT) is a powerful technique to improve model robustness in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. It is effective and can be easily adopted on lots of image classification and text classification tasks.

CRF can significantly boost accuracy for sequence models by putting constraints on label transitions, which makes it an essential component in most state-of-theart sequence labeling model architectures. In this paper, we propose SeqVAT, a method which naturally applies VAT to sequence labeling models with CRF.

Theme,Intermediate-Task Transfer Learning with Pretrained Language Models: When and Why Does It Work?,"While pretrained models such as BERT have shown large gains across natural language understanding tasks, their performance can be improved by further training the model on a data-rich intermediate task, before fine-tuning it on a target task. However, it is still poorly understood when and why intermediate-task training is beneficial for a given target task. To investigate this, we perform a large-scale study on the pretrained RoBERTa model with 110 intermediate-target task combinations. We further evaluate all trained models with 25 probing tasks meant to reveal the specific skills that drive transfer. We observe that intermediate tasks requiring high-level inference and reasoning abilities tend to work best. We also observe that target task performance is strongly correlated with higher-level abilities such as coreference resolution. However, we fail to observe more granular correlations between probing and target task performance, highlighting the need for further work on broad-coverage probing benchmarks. We also observe evidence that the forgetting of knowledge learned during pretraining may limit our analysis, highlighting the need for further work on transfer learning methods in these settings.","{'sequence': 'While pretrained models such as BERT have shown large gains across natural language understanding tasks, their performance can be improved by further training the model on a data-rich intermediate task, before fine-tuning it on a target task.

Theme,What Does BERT with Vision Look At?,"Pre-trained visually grounded language models such as ViLBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER have achieved significant performance improvement on vision-and-language tasks but what they learn during pre-training remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that certain attention heads of a visually grounded language model actively ground elements of language to image regions. Specifically, some heads can map entities to image regions, performing the task known as entity grounding. Some heads can even detect the syntactic relations between non-entity words and image regions, tracking, for example, associations between verbs and regions corresponding to their arguments.

Theme,A Tale of a Probe and a Parser,"Measuring what linguistic information is encoded in neural models of language has become popular in NLP. Researchers approach this enterprise by training ""probes""supervised models designed to extract linguistic structure from another model's output.

The structural probe has a novel design, unattested in the parsing literature, the precise benefit of which is not immediately obvious. To explore whether syntactic probes would do better to make use of existing techniques, we compare the structural probe to a more traditional parser with an identical lightweight parameterisation. The parser outperforms structural probe on UUAS in seven of nine analysed languages, often by a substantial amount (e.g. by 11.1 points in English). Under a second less common metric, however, there is the opposite trend-the structural probe outperforms the parser.

The parser outperforms structural probe on UUAS in seven of nine analysed languages, often by a substantial amount (e.g. by 11.1 points in English). Under a second less common metric, however, there is the opposite trend-the structural probe outperforms the parser. This begs the question: which metric should we prefer?', 'labels': ['NLP Applications', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theme', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Generation', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.12828569114208221, 0.11664864420890808, 0.07448327541351318, 0.05640344321727753, 0.0534345917403698, 0.048691004514694214, 0.04181709885597229, 0.038212284445762634, 0.03714048117399216, 0.03512360155582428, 0.03482266515493393, 0.0328766331076622, 0.03092029318213463, 0.028973836451768875, 0.027707960456609726, 0.027089163661003113, 0.026569368317723274, 0.02579426020383835, 0.025455482304096222, 0.020805303007364273, 0.020341088995337486, 0.0167720764875412, 0.015866858884692192, 0.015016122721135616, 0.013113719411194324, 0.007635088637471199]}",0.12828569114208221,NLP Applications,0.048691004514694214

Theme,Predictive Biases in Natural Language Processing Models: A Conceptual Framework and Overview,"An increasing number of natural language processing papers address the effect of bias on predictions, introducing mitigation techniques at different parts of the standard NLP pipeline (data and models). However, these works have been conducted individually, without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. This situation leads to repetitive approaches, and focuses overly on bias symptoms/effects, rather than on their origins, which could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a unifying predictive bias framework for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and suggest general mathematical definitions of predictive bias. We differentiate two consequences of bias: outcome disparities and error disparities, as well as four potential origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model overamplification, and semantic bias. Our framework serves as an overview of predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure, and providing a conceptual baseline for improved frameworks.","{'sequence': 'An increasing number of natural language processing papers address the effect of bias on predictions, introducing mitigation techniques at different parts of the standard NLP pipeline (data and models).

This paradigm favors simple, low-bias architectures, which, first, can be scaled to process vast amounts of data, and second, can capture the fine-grained statistical properties of a particular data set, regardless of whether those properties are likely to generalize to examples of the task outside the data set.

Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical),A Formal Hierarchy of RNN Architectures,"We develop a formal hierarchy of the expressive capacity of RNN architectures. The hierarchy is based on two formal properties: space complexity, which measures the RNN's memory, and rational recurrence, defined as whether the recurrent update can be described by a weighted finite-state machine. We place several RNN variants within this hierarchy. For example, we prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of ""saturated"" RNNs (Merrill, 2019) . While formally extending these findings to unsaturated RNNs is left to future work, we hypothesize that the practical learnable capacity of unsaturated RNNs obeys a similar hierarchy. Experimental findings from training unsaturated networks on formal languages support this conjecture. Proof. Choose k = 1.

Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical),Theoretical Limitations of Self-Attention in Neural Sequence Models,"Transformers are emerging as the new workhorse of NLP, showing great success across tasks. Unlike LSTMs, transformers process input sequences entirely through self-attention. Previous work has suggested that the computational capabilities of self-attention to process hierarchical structures are limited. In this work, we mathematically investigate the computational power of self-attention to model formal languages. Across both soft and hard attention, we show strong theoretical limitations of the computational abilities of selfattention, finding that it cannot model periodic finite-state languages, nor hierarchical structure, unless the number of layers or heads increases with input length. These limitations seem surprising given the practical success of self-attention and the prominent role assigned to hierarchical structure in linguistics, suggesting that natural language can be approximated well with models that are too weak for the formal languages typically assumed in theoretical linguistics.","{'sequence': 'Transformers are emerging as the new workhorse of NLP, showing great success across tasks.

System Demonstrations,CLIReval: Evaluating Machine Translation as a Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval Task,"We present CLIReval, an easy-to-use toolkit for evaluating machine translation (MT) with the proxy task of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). Contrary to what the project name might suggest, CLIReval does not actually require any annotated CLIR dataset. Instead, it automatically transforms translations and references used in MT evaluations into a synthetic CLIR dataset; it then sets up a standard search engine (Elasticsearch) and computes various information retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) by treating the translations as documents to be retrieved. The idea is to gauge the quality of MT by its impact on the document translation approach to CLIR. As a case study, we run CLIReval on the ""metrics shared task"" of WMT2019; while this extrinsic metric is not intended to replace popular intrinsic metrics such as BLEU, results suggest CLIReval is competitive in many language pairs in terms of correlation to human judgments of quality.

System Demonstrations,NSTM: Real-Time Query-Driven News Overview Composition at Bloomberg,"Millions of news articles from hundreds of thousands of sources around the globe appear in news aggregators every day. Consuming such a volume of news presents an almost insurmountable challenge. For example, a reader searching on Bloomberg's system for news about the U.K. would find 10,000 articles on a typical day. Apple Inc., the world's most journalistically covered company, garners around 1,800 news articles a day. We realized that a new kind of summarization engine was needed, one that would condense large volumes of news into short, easy to absorb points. The system would filter out noise and duplicates to identify and summarize key news about companies, countries or markets. When given a user query, Bloomberg's solution, Key News Themes (or NSTM), leverages state-of-the-art semantic clustering techniques and novel summarization methods to produce comprehensive, yet concise, digests to dramatically simplify the news consumption process. NSTM is available to hundreds of thousands of readers around the world and serves thousands of requests daily with sub-second latency. At ACL 2020, we will present a demo of NSTM. * Order reflects writing contributions; M.X., I.C.C., and J.B. designed and developed a prototype of the system; All implemented the production system; A.A. managed the project.

System Demonstrations,"MMPE: A Multi-Modal Interface using Handwriting, Touch Reordering, and Speech Commands for Post-Editing Machine Translation","The shift from traditional translation to postediting (PE) of machine-translated (MT) text can save time and reduce errors, but it also affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard, we present MMPE, the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen, touch, and speech modalities for PE of MT. Users can directly cross out or hand-write new text, drag and drop words for reordering, or use spoken commands to update the text in place. All text manipulations are logged in an easily interpretable format to simplify subsequent translation process research. The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions. Overall, experiment participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as useful extensions to mouse & keyboard, but not as a complete substitute.","{'sequence': 'The shift from traditional translation to postediting (PE) of machine-translated (MT) text can save time and reduce errors, but it also affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals.

System Demonstrations,Trialstreamer: Mapping and Browsing Medical Evidence in Real-Time,"We introduce Trialstreamer, a living database of clinical trial reports. Here we mainly describe the evidence extraction component; this extracts from biomedical abstracts key pieces of information that clinicians need when appraising the literature, and also the relations between these. Specifically, the system extracts descriptions of trial participants, the treatments compared in each arm (the interventions), and which outcomes were measured. The system then attempts to infer which interventions were reported to work best by determining their relationship with identified trial outcome measures. In addition to summarizing individual trials, these extracted data elements allow automatic synthesis of results across many trials on the same topic. We apply the system at scale to all reports of randomized controlled trials indexed in MEDLINE, powering the automatic generation of evidence maps, which provide a global view of the efficacy of different interventions combining data from all relevant clinical trials on a topic.

System Demonstrations,Syntactic Search by Example,"We present a system that allows a user to search a large linguistically annotated corpus using syntactic patterns over dependency graphs. In contrast to previous attempts to this effect, we introduce a light-weight query language that does not require the user to know the details of the underlying syntactic representations, and instead to query the corpus by providing an example sentence coupled with simple markup. Search is performed at an interactive speed due to an efficient linguistic graphindexing and retrieval engine. This allows for rapid exploration, development and refinement of syntax-based queries. We demonstrate the system using queries over two corpora: the English wikipedia, and a collection of English pubmed abstracts.

System Demonstrations,Conversation Learner - A Machine Teaching Tool for Building Dialog Managers for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems,"Traditionally, industry solutions for building a task-oriented dialog system have relied on helping dialog authors define rule-based dialog managers, represented as dialog flows. While dialog flows are intuitively interpretable and good for simple scenarios, they fall short of performance in terms of the flexibility needed to handle complex dialogs. On the other hand, purely machine-learned models can handle complex dialogs, but they are considered to be black boxes and require large amounts of training data. In this demonstration, we showcase Conversation Learner, a machine teaching tool for building dialog managers. It combines the best of both approaches by enabling dialog authors to create a dialog flow using familiar tools, converting the dialog flow into a parametric model (e.g., neural networks), and allowing dialog authors to improve the dialog manager (i.e., the parametric model) over time by leveraging user-system dialog logs as training data through a machine teaching interface.","{'sequence': 'Traditionally, industry solutions for building a task-oriented dialog system have relied on helping dialog authors define rule-based dialog managers, represented as dialog flows.

System Demonstrations,Photon: A Robust Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL System,"Natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) democratize end user access to relational data. Due to fundamental differences between natural language communication and programming, it is common for end users to issue questions that are ambiguous to the system or fall outside the semantic scope of its underlying query language. We present PHO-TON, a robust, modular, cross-domain NLIDB that can flag natural language input to which a SQL mapping cannot be immediately determined. PHOTON consists of a strong neural semantic parser (63.2% structure accuracy on the Spider dev benchmark), a human-in-theloop question corrector, a SQL executor and a response generator. The question corrector is a discriminative neural sequence editor which detects confusion span(s) in the input question and suggests rephrasing until a translatable input is given by the user or a maximum number of iterations are conducted. Experiments on simulated data show that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of text-to-SQL system against untranslatable user input. The live demo of our system is available at http://www.naturalsql.com. * Equal contribution. Jichuan implemented the demo interaction flow and the neural question corrector.

System Demonstrations,LEAN-LIFE: A Label-Efficient Annotation Framework Towards Learning from Explanation,"Successfully training a deep neural network demands a huge corpus of labeled data. However, each label only provides limited information to learn from and collecting the requisite number of labels involves massive human effort. In this work, we introduce LEAN-LIFE 1 , a web-based, Label-Efficient AnnotatioN framework for sequence labeling and classification tasks, with an easy-to-use UI that not only allows an annotator to provide the needed labels for a task, but also enables LearnIng From Explanations for each labeling decision. Such explanations enable us to generate useful additional labeled data from unlabeled instances, bolstering the pool of available training data. On three popular NLP tasks (named entity recognition, relation extraction, sentiment analysis), we find that using this enhanced supervision allows our models to surpass competitive baseline F1 scores by more than 5-10 percentage points, while using 2X times fewer labeled instances. Our framework is the first to utilize this enhanced supervision technique and does so for three important tasks--thus providing improved annotation recommendations to users and an ability to build datasets of (data, label, explanation) triples instead of the regular (data, label) pair.","{'sequence': 'Successfully training a deep neural network demands a huge corpus of labeled data.

System Demonstrations,Label Noise in Context,"Label noise-incorrectly or ambiguously labeled training examples-can negatively impact model performance. Although noise detection techniques have been around for decades, practitioners rarely apply them, as manual noise remediation is a tedious process. Examples incorrectly flagged as noise waste reviewers' time, and correcting label noise without guidance can be difficult. We propose LNIC, a noise-detection method that uses an example's neighborhood within the training set to (a) reduce false positives and (b) provide an explanation as to why the example was flagged as noise. We demonstrate on several short-text classification datasets that LNIC outperforms the state of the art on measures of precision and F 0.5 -score. We also show how LNIC's training set context helps a reviewer to understand and correct label noise in a dataset. The LNIC tool lowers the barriers to label noise remediation, increasing its utility for NLP practitioners.","{'sequence': ""Label noise-incorrectly or ambiguously labeled training examples-can negatively impact model performance.

System Demonstrations,SUPP.AI: finding evidence for supplement-drug interactions,"Dietary supplements are used by a large portion of the population, but information on their pharmacologic interactions is incomplete. To address this challenge, we present SUPP.AI, an application for browsing evidence of supplement-drug interactions (SDIs) extracted from the biomedical literature.

To address the lack of labeled data for SDI identification, we use labels of the closely related task of identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for supervision. We fine-tune the contextualized word representations of the RoBERTa language model using labeled DDI data, and apply the fine-tuned model to identify supplement interactions.

System Demonstrations,Prta: A System to Support the Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the News,"Recent events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, Brexit and the COVID-19 ""infodemic"", have brought into the spotlight the dangers of online disinformation. There has been a lot of research focusing on factchecking and disinformation detection. However, little attention has been paid to the specific rhetorical and psychological techniques used to convey propaganda messages. Revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of ""fake news"" and disinformation campaigns. Prta (Propaganda Persuasion Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore the articles crawled on a regular basis by highlighting the spans in which propaganda techniques occur and to compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques. The system further reports statistics about the use of such techniques, overall and over time, or according to filtering criteria specified by the user based on time interval, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media. Moreover, it allows users to analyze any text or URL through a dedicated interface or via an API.

It also allows researchers and developers to create their custom tools (e.g., pretrained NLP models) and use them in a controlled and reproducible way. In addition, the GUI interface enables researchers with limited computer background to compose tools into NLP pipelines and then apply the pipelines on their own datasets in a ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG) way.

Student Research Workshop,uBLEU: Uncertainty-Aware Automatic Evaluation Method for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems,"Because open-domain dialogues allow diverse responses, basic reference-based metrics such as BLEU do not work well unless we prepare a massive reference set of high-quality responses for input utterances. To reduce this burden, a human-aided, uncertainty-aware metric, ∆BLEU, has been proposed; it embeds human judgment on the quality of reference outputs into the computation of multiplereference BLEU. In this study, we instead propose a fully automatic, uncertainty-aware evaluation method for open-domain dialogue systems, υBLEU. This method first collects diverse reference responses from massive dialogue data and then annotates their quality judgments by using a neural network trained on automatically collected training data. Experimental results on massive Twitter data confirmed that υBLEU is comparable to ∆BLEU in terms of its correlation with human judgment and that the state of the art automatic evaluation method, RUBER, is improved by integrating υBLEU.","{'sequence': 'Because open-domain dialogues allow diverse responses, basic reference-based metrics such as BLEU do not work well unless we prepare a massive reference set of high-quality responses for input utterances.

Experimental results on massive Twitter data confirmed that υBLEU is comparable to ∆BLEU in terms of its correlation with human judgment and that the state of the art automatic evaluation method, RUBER, is improved by integrating υBLEU.', 'labels': ['Resources and Evaluation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theme', 'System Demonstrations', 'Information Extraction', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Summarization', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Generation', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'NLP Applications', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.07825915515422821, 0.07282426953315735, 0.06389359384775162, 0.04993278905749321, 0.04864107817411423, 0.04766065254807472, 0.04685540497303009, 0.04668859392404556, 0.04664764553308487, 0.04341248422861099, 0.03786896914243698, 0.034989021718502045, 0.03236949071288109, 0.032320208847522736, 0.031574297696352005, 0.030666209757328033, 0.03050074726343155, 0.029980558902025223, 0.02967122197151184, 0.029020024463534355, 0.027090949937701225, 0.02655009925365448, 0.02485739067196846, 0.022882459685206413, 0.02215544879436493, 0.01268720906227827]}",0.07825915515422821,Resources and Evaluation,0.04993278905749321
Student Research Workshop,Compositional Generalization by Factorizing Alignment and Translation,"Standard methods in deep learning for natural language processing fail to capture the compositional structure of human language that allows for systematic generalization outside of the training distribution.

In this regard, we study the effect of pseudo data on GEC task performance using two approaches. First, we extract sentences that are similar to the learners' sentences from monolingual data. Second, we generate realistic pseudo errors by considering error types that learners often make.

Student Research Workshop,To compress or not to compress? A Finite-State approach to Nen verbal morphology,"This paper describes the development of a verbal morphological parser for an underresourced Papuan language, Nen. Nen verbal morphology is particularly complex, with a transitive verb taking up to 1, 740 unique features. The structural properties exhibited by Nen verbs raises interesting choices for analysis. Here we compare two possible methods of analysis: 'Chunking' and decomposition. 'Chunking' refers to the concept of collating morphological segments into one, whereas the decomposition model follows a more classical linguistic approach. Both models are built using the Finite-State Transducer toolkit foma. The resultant architecture shows differences in size and structural clarity. While the 'Chunking' model is under half the size of the full decomposed counterpart, the decomposition displays higher structural order.

Student Research Workshop,Non-Topical Coherence in Social Talk: A Call for Dialogue Model Enrichment,"Current models of dialogue mainly focus on utterances within a topically coherent discourse segment, rather than new-topic utterances (NTUs), which begin a new topic not correlating with the content of prior discourse. As a result, these models may sufficiently account for discourse context of task-oriented but not social conversations. We conduct a pilot annotation study of NTUs as a first step towards a model capable of rationalizing conversational coherence in social talk. We start with the naturally occurring social dialogues in the Disco-SPICE corpus, annotated with discourse relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) and Cognitive approach to Coherence Relations (CCR) frameworks. We first annotate content-based coherence relations that are not available in Disco-SPICE, and then heuristically identify NTUs, which lack a coherence relation to prior discourse. Based on the interaction between NTUs and their discourse context, we construct a classification for NTUs that actually convey certain non-topical coherence in social talk. This classification introduces new sequence-based social intents that traditional taxonomies of speech acts do not capture. The new findings advocates the development of a Bayesian game-theoretic model for social talk. 1","{'sequence': 'Current models of dialogue mainly focus on utterances within a topically coherent discourse segment, rather than new-topic utterances (NTUs), which begin a new topic not correlating with the content of prior discourse.

Student Research Workshop,Crossing the Line: Where do Demographic Variables Fit into Humor Detection?,"Recent shared tasks in humor classification have struggled with two issues: scope and subjectivity. Regarding scope, many task datasets either comprise a highly constrained genre of humor which does not broadly represent the genre, or the data collection is so indiscriminate that the inter-annotator agreement on its comic content is drastically low. In terms of subjectivity, these tasks typically average over all annotators' judgments, in spite of the fact that humor is highly subjective and varies both between and within cultures. We propose a dataset which maintains a broad scope but which addresses subjectivity. We will collect demographic information about the data's humor annotators in order to bin ratings more sensibly. We also suggest the addition of an 'offensive' label to reflect the fact a text may be humorous to one group, but offensive to another. This would allow for more meaningful shared tasks and could lead to better performance on downstream applications, such as content moderation.","{'sequence': ""Recent shared tasks in humor classification have struggled with two issues: scope and subjectivity.

In terms of subjectivity, these tasks typically average over all annotators' judgments, in spite of the fact that humor is highly subjective and varies both between and within cultures. We propose a dataset which maintains a broad scope but which addresses subjectivity. We will collect demographic information about the data's humor annotators in order to bin ratings more sensibly. We also suggest the addition of an 'offensive' label to reflect the fact a text may be humorous to one group, but offensive to another. This would allow for more meaningful shared tasks and could lead to better performance on downstream applications, such as content moderation."", 'labels': ['Student Research Workshop', 'Theme', 'Question Answering', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Summarization', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Generation', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'System Demonstrations', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)'], 'scores': [0.08041699230670929, 0.07191476225852966, 0.065431609749794, 0.055964402854442596, 0.055785540491342545, 0.054153021425008774, 0.052479226142168045, 0.0497276671230793, 0.04714468494057655, 0.04170909523963928, 0.037233125418424606, 0.03641341254115105, 0.03328971192240715, 0.029504889622330666, 0.029428277164697647, 0.028223223984241486, 0.026582546532154083, 0.026058489456772804, 0.025964463129639626, 0.025751350447535515, 0.02497035823762417, 0.022430557757616043, 0.022370995953679085, 0.019986089318990707, 0.01891188882291317, 0.01815349981188774]}",0.08041699230670929,Student Research Workshop,0.08041699230670929

Student Research Workshop,HGCN4MeSH: Hybrid Graph Convolution Network for MeSH Indexing,"Recently, deep learning has been used in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexing to reduce the labor costs associated with manual annotation, including DeepMeSH, TextCNN, etc. However, these models fail to capture the complex correlations between MeSH terms. To this end, we use a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to learn the relationship between these terms and present a novel Hybrid Graph Convolution Net for MeSH index (HGCN4MeSH). We utilize two bidirectional GRUs to learn the embedding representation of the abstract and the title of the MeSH index text respectively. We construct the adjacency matrix of MeSH terms, based on the co-occurence relationships in corpus, and use the matrix to learn representations using the GCN. On the basis of learning the joint representation, the prediction problem of the MeSH index keywords is an extreme multi-label classification problem after the attention layer operation.

Student Research Workshop,Logical Inferences with Comparatives and Generalized Quantifiers,"Comparative constructions pose a challenge in Natural Language Inference (NLI), which is the task of determining whether a text entails a hypothesis. Comparatives are structurally complex in that they interact with other linguistic phenomena such as quantifiers, numerals, and lexical antonyms. In formal semantics, there is a rich body of work on comparatives and gradable expressions using the notion of degree. However, a logical inference system for comparatives has not been sufficiently developed for use in the NLI task. In this paper, we present a compositional semantics that maps various comparative constructions in English to semantic representations via Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parsers and combine it with an inference system based on automated theorem proving. We evaluate our system on three NLI datasets that contain complex logical inferences with comparatives, generalized quantifiers, and numerals.

Student Research Workshop,Feature Difference Makes Sense: A medical image captioning model exploiting feature difference and tag information,"Medical image captioning can reduce the workload of physicians and save time and expense by automatically generating reports. However, current datasets are small and limited, creating additional challenges for researchers. In this study, we propose a feature difference and tag information combined long short-term memory (LSTM) model for chest x-ray report generation. A feature vector extracted from the image conveys visual information, but its ability to describe the image is limited. Other image captioning studies exhibited improved performance by exploiting feature differences, so the proposed model also utilizes them. First, we propose a difference and tag (DiTag) model containing the difference between the patient and normal images. Then, we propose a multi-difference and tag (mDiTag) model that also contains information about low-level differences, such as contrast, texture, and localized area. Evaluation of the proposed models demonstrates that the mDiTag model provides more information to generate captions and outperforms all other models.","{'sequence': 'Medical image captioning can reduce the workload of physicians and save time and expense by automatically generating reports.

Student Research Workshop,Preventing Critical Scoring Errors in Short Answer Scoring with Confidence Estimation,"Many recent Short Answer Scoring (SAS) systems have employed Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation measure of their systems. However, we hypothesize that QWK is unsatisfactory for the evaluation of the SAS systems when we consider measuring their effectiveness in actual usage. We introduce a new task formulation of SAS that matches the actual usage. In our formulation, the SAS systems should extract as many scoring predictions that are not critical scoring errors (CSEs). We conduct the experiments in our new task formulation and demonstrate that a typical SAS system can predict scores with zero CSE for approximately 50% of test data at maximum by filtering out low-reliablility predictions on the basis of a certain confidence estimation. This result directly indicates the possibility of reducing half the scoring cost of human raters, which is more preferable for the evaluation of SAS systems.","{'sequence': 'Many recent Short Answer Scoring (SAS) systems have employed Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation measure of their systems.

Student Research Workshop,Efficient Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages via Exploiting Related Languages,"A large percentage of the world's population speaks a language of the Indian subcontinent, comprising languages from both Indo-Aryan (e.g. Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, etc.) and Dravidian (e.g. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, etc.) families. A universal characteristic of Indian languages is their complex morphology, which, when combined with the general lack of sufficient quantities of high-quality parallel data, can make developing machine translation (MT) systems for these languages difficult. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a rapidly advancing MT paradigm and has shown promising results for many language pairs, especially in large training data scenarios. Since the condition of large parallel corpora is not met for Indian-English language pairs, we present our efforts towards building efficient NMT systems between Indian languages (specifically Indo-Aryan languages) and English via efficiently exploiting parallel data from the related languages. We propose a technique called Unified Transliteration and Subword Segmentation to leverage language similarity while exploiting parallel data from related language pairs. We also propose a Multilingual Transfer Learning technique to leverage parallel data from multiple related languages to assist translation for lowresource language pair of interest. Our experiments demonstrate an overall average improvement of 5 BLEU points over the standard Transformer-based NMT baselines.","{'sequence': ""A large percentage of the world's population speaks a language of the Indian subcontinent, comprising languages from both Indo-Aryan (e.g. Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, etc.) and Dravidian (e.g. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, etc.) families.

Student Research Workshop,Pointwise Paraphrase Appraisal is Potentially Problematic,"The prevailing approach for training and evaluating paraphrase identification models is constructed as a binary classification problem: the model is given a pair of sentences, and is judged by how accurately it classifies pairs as either paraphrases or non-paraphrases. This pointwise-based evaluation method does not match well the objective of most real world applications, so the goal of our work is to understand how models which perform well under pointwise evaluation may fail in practice and find better methods for evaluating paraphrase identification models. As a first step towards that goal, we show that although the standard way of fine-tuning BERT for paraphrase identification by pairing two sentences as one sequence results in a model with state-of-the-art performance, that model may perform poorly on simple tasks like identifying pairs with two identical sentences.

The types of points of correspondence are delineated by text cohesion theory, covering pronominal and nominal referencing, repetition and beyond. We create a dataset containing the documents, source and fusion sentences, and human annotations of points of correspondence between sentences.

Further, we are able to achieve an accuracy of 75.76% for predicting the replicability of research."", 'labels': ['Information Extraction', 'Question Answering', 'System Demonstrations', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Theme', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'NLP Applications', 'Generation', 'Summarization', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.12077061831951141, 0.061818741261959076, 0.059886183589696884, 0.05936698988080025, 0.055375758558511734, 0.04643591493368149, 0.042999107390642166, 0.04126324877142906, 0.037021052092313766, 0.03654979169368744, 0.036395538598299026, 0.03594003990292549, 0.03587622195482254, 0.03486856073141098, 0.03404759615659714, 0.03343391790986061, 0.03235732018947601, 0.03230581432580948, 0.03182847425341606, 0.024916470050811768, 0.024647118523716927, 0.021913204342126846, 0.017325541004538536, 0.014638636261224747, 0.014204462058842182, 0.013813783414661884]}",0.12077061831951141,Information Extraction,0.03594003990292549
Student Research Workshop,How much complexity does an RNN architecture need to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies?,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and their variants are capable of encapsulating long-range dependencies, which is evident from their performance on a variety of linguistic tasks. On the other hand, simple recurrent networks (SRNs), which appear more biologically grounded in terms of synaptic connections, have generally been less successful at capturing long-range dependencies as well as the loci of grammatical errors in an unsupervised setting. In this paper, we seek to develop models that bridge the gap between biological plausibility and linguistic competence. We propose a new architecture, the Decay RNN, which incorporates the decaying nature of neuronal activations and models the excitatory and inhibitory connections in a population of neurons. Besides its biological inspiration, our model also shows competitive performance relative to LSTMs on subject-verb agreement, sentence grammaticality, and language modeling tasks. These results provide some pointers towards probing the nature of the inductive biases required for RNN architectures to model linguistic phenomena successfully.","{'sequence': 'Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and their variants are capable of encapsulating long-range dependencies, which is evident from their performance on a variety of linguistic tasks.

Our experiments show that this approach maintains the translation quality with respect to the normal Transformer model when no extra word-level information is injected and that it is superior to the currently dominant method for incorporating word-level source language information to models based on subword-level vocabularies.', 'labels': ['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Information Extraction', 'System Demonstrations', 'Question Answering', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Theme', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Generation', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'NLP Applications', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Summarization', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.11147920042276382, 0.05929332599043846, 0.05834619328379631, 0.05410154536366463, 0.0497201532125473, 0.049687858670949936, 0.0441705547273159, 0.04405831918120384, 0.043796177953481674, 0.04256457835435867, 0.04143460467457771, 0.040322594344615936, 0.03858960047364235, 0.034830279648303986, 0.03195524215698242, 0.029746219515800476, 0.02795255370438099, 0.027551213279366493, 0.027498552575707436, 0.02632325515151024, 0.025088811293244362, 0.022132249549031258, 0.021667176857590675, 0.019937682896852493, 0.01830444484949112, 0.009447607211768627]}",0.11147920042276382,Machine Translation and Multilinguality,0.03858960047364235
Student Research Workshop,Effectively Aligning and Filtering Parallel Corpora under Sparse Data Conditions,"Parallel corpora are key to developing good machine translation systems. However, abundant parallel data are hard to come by, especially for languages with a low number of speakers. When rich morphology exacerbates the data sparsity problem, it is imperative to have accurate alignment and filtering methods that can help make the most of what is available by maximising the number of correctly translated segments in a corpus and minimising noise by removing incorrect translations and segments containing extraneous data. This paper sets out a research plan for improving alignment and filtering methods for parallel texts in low-resource settings. We propose an effective unsupervised alignment method to tackle the alignment problem. Moreover, we propose a strategy to supplement state-of-theart models with automatically extracted information using basic NLP tools to effectively handle rich morphology.","{'sequence': 'Parallel corpora are key to developing good machine translation systems.

Student Research Workshop,"Media Bias, the Social Sciences, and NLP: Automating Frame Analyses to Identify Bias by Word Choice and Labeling","Media bias can strongly impact the public perception of topics reported in the news. A difficult to detect, yet powerful form of slanted news coverage is called bias by word choice and labeling (WCL). WCL bias can occur, for example, when journalists refer to the same semantic concept by using different terms that frame the concept differently and consequently may lead to different assessments by readers, such as the terms ""freedom fighters"" and ""terrorists,"" or ""gun rights"" and ""gun control."" In this research project, I aim to devise methods that identify instances of WCL bias and estimate the frames they induce, e.g., not only is ""terrorists"" of negative polarity but also ascribes to aggression and fear. To achieve this, I plan to research methods using natural language processing and deep learning while employing models and using analysis concepts from the social sciences, where researchers have studied media bias for decades. The first results indicate the effectiveness of this interdisciplinary research approach. My vision is to devise a system that helps news readers to become aware of the differences in media coverage caused by bias.","{'sequence': 'Media bias can strongly impact the public perception of topics reported in the news.

After the decoding process, we select a few last iteration outputs in the training process as the N -best list.

With this method, we achieved a translation improvement up to +0.16 BLEU points over baseline.We also evaluate our approach by applying the coverage penalty to the training process.In cases of moderate coverage penalty, the oracle scores are higher than the final iteration up to +0.99 BLEU points, and our algorithm gives an improvement up to +0.17 BLEU points.With excessive penalty, there is a decrease in translation quality compared to the baseline system. Still, an increase in oracle scores up to +1.30 is observed with the re-ranking algorithm giving an improvement up to +0.15 BLEU points is found in case of excessive penalty.The proposed re-ranking method is a generic one and can be extended to other language pairs as well.","{'sequence': ""In this paper, we propose a method of reranking the outputs of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems.

We propose to replace the rich linguistic feature templates used in the past approaches with a minimal feature function using contextual vector representations. We train a BERT model on the Telugu Wikipedia data and use vector representations from this model to train the parser. Each sentence token is associated with a vector representing the token in the context of that sentence and the feature vectors are constructed by concatenating two token representations from the stack and one from the buffer. We put the feature representations through a feed forward network and train with a greedy transition based approach.

The resulting parser has a very simple architecture with minimal feature engineering and achieves state-of-the-art results for Telugu.', 'labels': ['Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing', 'Theme', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'System Demonstrations', 'Information Extraction', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Speech and Multimodality', 'NLP Applications', 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas', 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation', 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics', 'Computational Social Science and Social Media', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Generation', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Machine Learning for NLP', 'Discourse and Pragmatics', 'Question Answering', 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)', 'Ethics and NLP', 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond', 'Student Research Workshop', 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics', 'Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining'], 'scores': [0.09078598022460938, 0.07632717490196228, 0.06261461228132248, 0.060056962072849274, 0.05733491852879524, 0.050507720559835434, 0.04975009709596634, 0.046786919236183167, 0.045709576457738876, 0.04384602978825569, 0.0383170060813427, 0.036996617913246155, 0.035472773015499115, 0.034426748752593994, 0.0335843525826931, 0.032342009246349335, 0.029357044026255608, 0.027701403945684433, 0.025882182642817497, 0.02374998666346073, 0.020700814202427864, 0.019389891996979713, 0.018621381372213364, 0.01618548110127449, 0.013627246022224426, 0.009925110265612602]}",0.09078598022460938,"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",0.018621381372213364
Student Research Workshop,Inducing Grammar from Long Short-Term Memory Networks by Shapley Decomposition,"The principle of compositionality has deep roots in linguistics: the meaning of an expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents. However, modern neural network models such as long shortterm memory network process expressions in a linear fashion and do not seem to incorporate more complex compositional patterns. In this work, we show that we can explicitly induce grammar by tracing the computational process of a long short-term memory network. We show: (i) the multiplicative nature of long short-term memory network allows complex interaction beyond sequential linear combination; (ii) we can generate compositional trees from the network without external linguistic knowledge; (iii) we evaluate the syntactic difference between the generated trees, randomly generated trees and gold reference trees produced by constituency parsers; (iv) we evaluate whether the generated trees contain the rich semantic information. 1","{'sequence': 'The principle of compositionality has deep roots in linguistics: the meaning of an expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents.
