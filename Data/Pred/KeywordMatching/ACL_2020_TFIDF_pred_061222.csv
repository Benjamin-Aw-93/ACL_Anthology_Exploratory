"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Overestimation of Syntactic Representation in Neural Language Models,"With the advent of powerful neural language models over the last few years, research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they represent that make them so successful. Several testing methodologies have been developed to probe models' syntactic representations. One popular method for determining a model's ability to induce syntactic structure trains a model on strings generated according to a template then tests the model's ability to distinguish such strings from superficially similar ones with different syntax. We illustrate a fundamental problem with this approach by reproducing positive results from a recent paper with two non-syntactic baseline language models: an n-gram model and an LSTM model trained on scrambled inputs.","Overestimation of Syntactic Representation in Neural Language Models With the advent of powerful neural language models over the last few years, research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they represent that make them so successful.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Inflecting When There's No Majority: Limitations of Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks as Cognitive Models for German Plurals,"Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do? Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form /-(e)d/ to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995) : that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class -and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like /-s/ can still be productively generalized. To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization.","Inflecting When There's No Majority: Limitations of Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks as Cognitive Models for German Plurals Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do?

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",A Systematic Assessment of Syntactic Generalization in Neural Language Models,"While state-of-the-art neural network models continue to achieve lower perplexity scores on language modeling benchmarks, it remains unknown whether optimizing for broad-coverage predictive performance leads to human-like syntactic knowledge. Furthermore, existing work has not provided a clear picture about the model properties required to produce proper syntactic generalizations. We present a systematic evaluation of the syntactic knowledge of neural language models, testing 20 combinations of model types and data sizes on a set of 34 English-language syntactic test suites. We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M-40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments. Our results also reveal a dissociation between perplexity and syntactic generalization performance.","A Systematic Assessment of Syntactic Generalization in Neural Language Models While state-of-the-art neural network models continue to achieve lower perplexity scores on language modeling benchmarks, it remains unknown whether optimizing for broad-coverage predictive performance leads to human-like syntactic knowledge.

Accurately diagnosing depression is difficult-requiring time-intensive interviews, assessments, and analysis. Hence, automated methods that can assess linguistic patterns in these interviews could help psychiatric professionals make faster, more informed decisions about diagnosis. We propose JLPC, a method that analyzes interview transcripts to identify depression while jointly categorizing interview prompts into latent categories. This latent categorization allows the model to identify high-level conversational contexts that influence patterns of language in depressed individuals. We show that the proposed model not only outperforms competitive baselines, but that its latent prompt categories provide psycholinguistic insights about depression.","Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Latent Categorization of Interview Prompts Despite the pervasiveness of clinical depression in modern society, professional help remains highly stigmatized, inaccessible, and expensive.

However, previous work has dealt with a limited number of participants as well as word level only predictions (i.e. predicting the time to read a single word). We seek to extend these works by examining whether or not document level predictions are effective, given additional information such as subject matter, font characteristics, and readability metrics. We perform a novel experiment to examine how different features of text contribute to the time it takes to read, distributing and collecting data from over a thousand participants. We then employ a large number of machine learning methods to predict a user's reading time. We find that despite extensive research showing that word level reading time can be most effectively predicted by neural networks, larger scale text can be easily and most accurately predicted by one factor, the number of words.","You Don't Have Time to Read This: An Exploration of Document Reading Time Prediction Predicting reading time has been a subject of much previous work, focusing on how different words affect human processing, measured by reading time.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Learning to Understand Child-directed and Adult-directed Speech,"Speech directed to children differs from adultdirected speech in linguistic aspects such as repetition, word choice, and sentence length, as well as in aspects of the speech signal itself, such as prosodic and phonemic variation. Human language acquisition research indicates that child-directed speech helps language learners. This study explores the effect of child-directed speech when learning to extract semantic information from speech directly. We compare the task performance of models trained on adult-directed speech (ADS) and child-directed speech (CDS). We find indications that CDS helps in the initial stages of learning, but eventually, models trained on ADS reach comparable task performance, and generalize better. The results suggest that this is at least partially due to linguistic rather than acoustic properties of the two registers, as we see the same pattern when looking at models trained on acoustically comparable synthetic speech.","Learning to Understand Child-directed and Adult-directed Speech Speech directed to children differs from adultdirected speech in linguistic aspects such as repetition, word choice, and sentence length, as well as in aspects of the speech signal itself, such as prosodic and phonemic variation.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",Recollection versus Imagination: Exploring Human Memory and Cognition via Neural Language Models,"We investigate the use of NLP as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events. To facilitate this, we collect and release HIPPOCORPUS, a dataset of 7,000 stories about imagined and recalled events. We introduce a measure of narrative flow and use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled events. Additionally, we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. Our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow, compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. In addition, while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory, imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. Finally, our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories (e.g., stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; Bartlett, 1932) . Our findings highlight the potential of using NLP tools to study the traces of human cognition in language.","Recollection versus Imagination: Exploring Human Memory and Cognition via Neural Language Models We investigate the use of NLP as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events.

"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics",What determines the order of adjectives in English? Comparing efficiency-based theories using dependency treebanks,"We take up the scientific question of what determines the preferred order of adjectives in English, in phrases such as big blue box where multiple adjectives modify a following noun. We implement and test four quantitative theories, all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. The four theories we test are subjectivity (Scontras et al., 2017) , information locality (Futrell, 2019), integration cost (Dyer, 2017), and information gain, which we introduce. We evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. We find that subjectivity, information locality, and information gain are all strong predictors, with some evidence for a two-factor account, where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics, and information locality reflects collocational preferences.","What determines the order of adjectives in English?

To overcome the first two limitations, we propose Topic-Post-Comment Graph Convolutional Network (TPC-GCN), which integrates the information from the graph structure and content of topics, posts, and comments for post-level controversy detection. As to the third limitation, we extend our model to Disentangled TPC-GCN (DTPC-GCN), to disentangle topic-related and topic-unrelated features and then fuse dynamically.

The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction.

But trust can be betrayed through deception. We study the language and dynamics of deception in the negotiation-based game Diplomacy, where seven players compete for world domination by forging and breaking alliances with each other. Our study with players from the Diplomacy community gathers 17,289 messages annotated by the sender for their intended truthfulness and by the receiver for their perceived truthfulness.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,DTCA: Decision Tree-based Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Claim Verification,"Recently, many methods discover effective evidence from reliable sources by appropriate neural networks for explainable claim verification, which has been widely recognized. However, in these methods, the discovery process of evidence is nontransparent and unexplained. Simultaneously, the discovered evidence only roughly aims at the interpretability of the whole sequence of claims but insufficient to focus on the false parts of claims. In this paper, we propose a Decision Tree-based Co-Attention model (DTCA) to discover evidence for explainable claim verification.

Computational Social Science and Social Media,Balancing Objectives in Counseling Conversations: Advancing Forwards or Looking Backwards,"Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction. Such choices are particularly salient in the consequential domain of crisis counseling, where a difficulty for counselors is balancing between two key objectives: advancing the conversation towards a resolution, and empathetically addressing the crisis situation. In this work, we develop an unsupervised methodology to quantify how counselors manage this balance. Our main intuition is that if an utterance can only receive a narrow range of appropriate replies, then its likely aim is to advance the conversation forwards, towards a target within that range. Likewise, an utterance that can only appropriately follow a narrow range of possible utterances is likely aimed backwards at addressing a specific situation within that range. By applying this intuition, we can map each utterance to a continuous orientation axis that captures the degree to which it is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards. This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its effectiveness.","Balancing Objectives in Counseling Conversations: Advancing Forwards or Looking Backwards Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling,"As an essential task in task-oriented dialog systems, slot filling requires extensive training data in a certain domain. However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-theart approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Data Manipulation: Towards Effective Instance Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation via Learning to Augment and Reweight,"Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm. As such, a reliable training corpus is the crux of building a robust and well-behaved dialogue model. However, due to the open-ended nature of human conversations, the quality of user-generated training data varies greatly, and effective training samples are typically insufficient while noisy samples frequently appear. This impedes the learning of those data-driven neural dialogue models. Therefore, effective dialogue learning requires not only more reliable learning samples, but also fewer noisy samples. In this paper, we propose a data manipulation framework to proactively reshape the data distribution towards reliable samples by augmenting and highlighting effective learning samples as well as reducing the effect of inefficient samples simultaneously. In particular, the data manipulation model selectively augments the training samples and assigns an importance weight to each instance to reform the training data. Note that, the proposed data manipulation framework is fully data-driven and learnable. It not only manipulates training samples to optimize the dialogue generation model, but also learns to increase its manipulation skills through gradient descent with validation samples. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the dialogue generation performance with respect to various automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments.","Data Manipulation: Towards Effective Instance Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation via Learning to Augment and Reweight Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,CDL: Curriculum Dual Learning for Emotion-Controllable Response Generation,"Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging. Existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization terms to standard cross-entropy loss and thus influence the training process. However, due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency, the common problem of response generation tasks, safe response, is intensified. Besides, query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and response are simply ignored in previous models, which would further hurt the coherence. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework named Curriculum Dual Learning (CDL) which extends the emotion-controllable response generation to a dual task to generate emotional responses and emotional queries alternatively. CDL utilizes two rewards focusing on emotion and content to improve the duality. Additionally, it applies curriculum learning to gradually generate high-quality responses based on the difficulties of expressing various emotions. Experimental results show that CDL significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of coherence, diversity, and relation to emotion factors.","CDL: Curriculum Dual Learning for Emotion-Controllable Response Generation Emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging. Existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization terms to standard cross-entropy loss and thus influence the training process. However, due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency, the common problem of response generation tasks, safe response, is intensified. Besides, query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and response are simply ignored in previous models, which would further hurt the coherence.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,"The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot","This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world. XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast humanmachine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of largescale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.","The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world.

This is insufficient for training intermediate dialogue turns since supervision signals (or rewards) are only provided at the end of dialogues.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel reward learning approach for semisupervised policy learning. The proposed approach learns a dynamics model as the reward function which models dialogue progress (i.e., state-action sequences) based on expert demonstrations, either with or without annotations. The dynamics model computes rewards by predicting whether the dialogue progress is consistent with expert demonstrations.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Large Scale Multi-Actor Generative Dialog Modeling,"Non-goal oriented dialog agents (i.e. chatbots) aim to produce varying and engaging conversations with a user; however, they typically exhibit either inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all users. This paper addresses these issues by controlling an agent's persona upon generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the GENERATIVE CONVERSATION CONTROL model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model multi-turn conversations in the actor's persona. We introduce an accompanying data collection procedure to obtain 10.3M conversations from 6 months worth of Reddit comments. We demonstrate that scaling model sizes from 117M to 8.3B parameters yields an improvement from 23.14 to 13.14 perplexity on 1.7M held out Reddit conversations. Increasing model scale yielded similar improvements in human evaluations that measure preference of model samples to the held out target distribution in terms of realism (31% increased to 37% preference), style matching (37% to 42%), grammar and content quality (29% to 42%), and conversation coherency (32% to 40%).

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Conversational Word Embedding for Retrieval-Based Dialog System,"Human conversations contain many types of information, e.g., knowledge, common sense, and language habits. In this paper, we propose a conversational word embedding method named PR-Embedding, which utilizes the conversation pairs post, reply 1 to learn word embedding. Different from previous works, PR-Embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply. To catch the information among the pair, we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window, then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level. We evaluate the method on single-turn and multi-turn response selection tasks for retrieval-based dialog systems.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Unknown Intent Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model with an Application to Zero-shot Intent Classification,"User intent classification plays a vital role in dialogue systems. Since user intent may frequently change over time in many realistic scenarios, unknown (new) intent detection has become an essential problem, where the study has just begun. This paper proposes a semantic-enhanced Gaussian mixture model (SEG) for unknown intent detection. In particular, we model utterance embeddings with a Gaussian mixture distribution and inject dynamic class semantic information into Gaussian means, which enables learning more classconcentrated embeddings that help to facilitate downstream outlier detection. Coupled with a density-based outlier detection algorithm, SEG achieves competitive results on three real task-oriented dialogue datasets in two languages for unknown intent detection. On top of that, we propose to integrate SEG as an unknown intent identifier into existing generalized zero-shot intent classification models to improve their performance. A case study on a state-of-the-art method, ReCapsNet, shows that SEG can push the classification performance to a significantly higher level.","Unknown Intent Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model with an Application to Zero-shot Intent Classification User intent classification plays a vital role in dialogue systems.

Tremendous progress has been made in recent years. However, the major challenges remain. The state-of-the-art accuracy for DST is below 50% for a multi-domain dialogue task. A learnable DST for any new domain requires a large amount of labeled indomain data and training from scratch. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Reinforced Multi-Domain State Generator (MERET). Our first contribution is to improve the DST accuracy. We enhance a neural model based DST generator with a reward manager, which is built on policy gradient reinforcement learning (R-L) to fine-tune the generator. With this change, we are able to improve the joint accuracy of DST from 48.79% to 50.91% on the Multi-WOZ corpus. Second, we explore to train a DST meta-learning model with a few domains as source domains and a new domain as target domain. We apply the model-agnostic metalearning (MAML) algorithm to DST and the obtained meta-learning model is used for new domain adaptation.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Beyond User Self-Reported Likert Scale Ratings: A Comparison Model for Automatic Dialog Evaluation,"Open Domain dialog system evaluation is one of the most important challenges in dialog research. Existing automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU are mostly referencebased. They calculate the difference between the generated response and a limited number of available references. Likert-score based self-reported user rating is widely adopted by social conversational systems, such as Amazon Alexa Prize chatbots. However, selfreported user rating suffers from bias and variance among different users. To alleviate this problem, we formulate dialog evaluation as a comparison task. We also propose an automatic evaluation model CMADE (Comparison Model for Automatic Dialog Evaluation) that automatically cleans self-reported user ratings as it trains on them. Specifically, we first use a self-supervised method to learn better dialog feature representation, and then use KNN and Shapley to remove confusing samples.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Diverse and Informative Dialogue Generation with Context-Specific Commonsense Knowledge Awareness,"Generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses, which often leads to boring conversations.

Thus, the introduction of the context-irrelevant knowledge facts can impact the quality of generations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel commonsense knowledge-aware dialogue generation model, ConKADI. We design a Felicitous Fact mechanism to help the model focus on the knowledge facts that are highly relevant to the context; furthermore, two techniques, Context-Knowledge Fusion and Flexible Mode Fusion are proposed to facilitate the integration of the knowledge in the ConKADI.

In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations.

Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth.

In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled conversation corpus. Our approach considers the speakers in defining the different levels of similar context.

Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth. One approach to resolve this problem is to consider the similarity of the generated response with the conversational context. In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled conversation corpus. Our approach considers the speakers in defining the different levels of similar context.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Few-shot Slot Tagging with Collapsed Dependency Transfer and Label-enhanced Task-adaptive Projection Network,"In this paper, we explore the slot tagging with only a few labeled support sentences (a.k.a. few-shot). Few-shot slot tagging faces a unique challenge compared to the other fewshot classification problems as it calls for modeling the dependencies between labels. But it is hard to apply previously learned label dependencies to an unseen domain, due to the discrepancy of label sets. To tackle this, we introduce a collapsed dependency transfer mechanism into the conditional random field (CRF) to transfer abstract label dependency patterns as transition scores. In the few-shot setting, the emission score of CRF can be calculated as a word's similarity to the representation of each label. To calculate such similarity, we propose a Label-enhanced Task-Adaptive Projection Network (L-TapNet) based on the stateof-the-art few-shot classification model -Tap-Net, by leveraging label name semantics in representing labels. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the strongest few-shot learning baseline by 14.64","Few-shot Slot Tagging with Collapsed Dependency Transfer and Label-enhanced Task-adaptive Projection Network In this paper, we explore the slot tagging with only a few labeled support sentences (a.k.a. few-shot).

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Multi-Domain Dialogue Acts and Response Co-Generation,"Generating fluent and informative responses is of critical importance for task-oriented dialogue systems. Existing pipeline approaches generally predict multiple dialogue acts first and use them to assist response generation. There are at least two shortcomings with such approaches. First, the inherent structures of multi-domain dialogue acts are neglected. Second, the semantic associations between acts and responses are not taken into account for response generation. To address these issues, we propose a neural co-generation model that generates dialogue acts and responses concurrently. Unlike those pipeline approaches, our act generation module preserves the semantic structures of multi-domain dialogue acts and our response generation module dynamically attends to different acts as needed. We train the two modules jointly using an uncertainty loss to adjust their task weights adaptively.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Can You Put it All Together: Evaluating Conversational Agents' Ability to Blend Skills,"Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent. Previous work has introduced tasks and datasets that aim to help agents to learn those qualities in isolation and gauge how well they can express them. But rather than being specialized in one single quality, a good open-domain conversational agent should be able to seamlessly blend them all into one cohesive conversational flow. In this work, we investigate several ways to combine models trained towards isolated capabilities, ranging from simple model aggregation schemes that require minimal additional training, to various forms of multi-task training that encompass several skills at all training stages. We further propose a new dataset, Blended-SkillTalk, to analyze how these capabilities would mesh together in a natural conversation, and compare the performance of different architectures and training schemes. Our experiments show that multi-tasking over several tasks that focus on particular capabilities results in better blended conversation performance compared to models trained on a single skill, and that both unified or two-stage approaches perform well if they are constructed to avoid unwanted bias in skill selection or are fine-tuned on our new task.","Can You Put it All Together: Evaluating Conversational Agents' Ability to Blend Skills Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent.

Dialogue and Interactive Systems,Learning to Customize Model Structures for Few-shot Dialogue Generation Tasks,"Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems. Existing methods tend to use the meta-learning framework which pre-trains the parameters on all non-target tasks then fine-tunes on the target task. However, fine-tuning distinguishes tasks from the parameter perspective but ignores the model-structure perspective, resulting in similar dialogue models for different tasks. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can customize a unique dialogue model for each task in the few-shot setting. In our approach, each dialogue model consists of a shared module, a gating module, and a private module. The first two modules are shared among all the tasks, while the third one will differentiate into different network structures to better capture the characteristics of the corresponding task. The extensive experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms all the baselines in terms of task consistency, response quality, and diversity.","Learning to Customize Model Structures for Few-shot Dialogue Generation Tasks Training the generative models with minimal corpus is one of the critical challenges for building open-domain dialogue systems.

On the basis, we propose a top-down neural architecture toward text-level DRS parsing. In particular, we cast discourse parsing as a recursive split point ranking task, where a split point is classified to different levels according to its rank and the elementary discourse units (EDUs) associated with it are arranged accordingly. In this way, we can determine the complete DRS as a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack.

Ethics and NLP,Towards Debiasing Sentence Representations,"As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes. Previous work has revealed the presence of social biases in widely used word embeddings involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. While some methods were proposed to debias these word-level embeddings, there is a need to perform debiasing at the sentence-level given the recent shift towards new contextualized sentence representations such as ELMo and BERT. In this paper, we investigate the presence of social biases in sentence-level representations and propose a new method, SENT-DEBIAS, to reduce these biases. We show that SENT-DEBIAS is effective in removing biases, and at the same time, preserves performance on sentence-level downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and natural language understanding. We hope that our work will inspire future research on characterizing and removing social biases from widely adopted sentence representations for fairer NLP.","Towards Debiasing Sentence Representations As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes.

Ethics and NLP,Demographics Should Not Be the Reason of Toxicity: Mitigating Discrimination in Text Classifications with Instance Weighting,"With the recent proliferation of the use of text classifications, researchers have found that there are certain unintended biases in text classification datasets.

As a result, models trained with these datasets may consider sentences like ""She makes me happy to be gay"" as abusive simply because of the word ""gay."" In this paper, we formalize the unintended biases in text classification datasets as a kind of selection bias from the non-discrimination distribution to the discrimination distribution. Based on this formalization, we further propose a model-agnostic debiasing training framework by recovering the non-discrimination distribution using instance weighting, which does not require any extra resources or annotations apart from a pre-defined set of demographic identity-terms.

Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES from unstructured text. We find that while stateof-the-art neural models are effective at highlevel categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F 1 ), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES.

Ethics and NLP,Is Your Classifier Actually Biased? Measuring Fairness under Uncertainty with Bernstein Bounds,"Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity). However, manually annotating a large dataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating all the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to estimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated sample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias. In this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty about the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence that a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true bias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call Bernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed biased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim. Our findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific biases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious cases. For example, consider a coreference resolution system that is 5% more accurate on gender-stereotypical sentences -to claim it is biased with 95% confidence, we need a bias-specific dataset that is 3.8 times larger than WinoBias, the largest available.","Is Your Classifier Actually Biased?

Ethics and NLP,Double-Hard Debias: Tailoring Word Embeddings for Gender Bias Mitigation,"Word embeddings derived from humangenerated corpora inherit strong gender bias which can be further amplified by downstream models.

Generation,A Knowledge-Enhanced Pretraining Model for Commonsense Story Generation,"Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task. In spite of the success in modeling fluency and local coherence, existing neural language generation models (e.g., GPT-2) still suffer from repetition, logic conflicts, and lack of long-range coherence in generated stories. We conjecture that this is because of the difficulty of associating relevant commonsense knowledge, understanding the causal relationships, and planning entities and events with proper temporal order. In this paper, we devise a knowledge-enhanced pretraining model for commonsense story generation. We propose to utilize commonsense knowledge from external knowledge bases to generate reasonable stories. To further capture the causal and temporal dependencies between the sentences in a reasonable story, we use multi-task learning, which combines a discriminative objective to distinguish true and fake stories during fine-tuning. Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more reasonable stories than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in terms of logic and global coherence.","A Knowledge-Enhanced Pretraining Model for Commonsense Story Generation Story generation, namely, generating a reasonable story from a leading context, is an important but challenging task.

To narrow this gap, we propose DUA-LENC, a dual encoding model that can not only incorporate the graph structure, but can also cater to the linear structure of the output text.

We also provide a dataset of more than 1.39 million instances automatically labeled for politeness to encourage benchmark evaluations on this new task. We design a tag and generate pipeline that identifies stylistic attributes and subsequently generates a sentence in the target style while preserving most of the source content. For politeness as well as five other transfer tasks, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics for content preservation, with a comparable or better performance on style transfer accuracy. Additionally, our model surpasses existing methods on human evaluations for grammaticality, meaning preservation and transfer accuracy across all the six style transfer tasks.

It is also imperative to use the appropriate level of politeness for smooth communication in conversations (Coppock, 2005) , organizational settings like emails (Peterson et al., 2011) , memos, official documents, and many other settings. Notably, politeness has also been identified as an interpersonal style which can be decoupled from content (Kang and Hovy, 2019).

The data and code is located at https:// github.com/tag-and-generate/ Introduction Politeness plays a crucial role in social interaction, and is closely tied with power dynamics, social distance between the participants of a conversation, and gender (Brown et al., 1987; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013) . It is also imperative to use the appropriate level of politeness for smooth communication in conversations (Coppock, 2005) , organizational settings like emails (Peterson et al., 2011) , memos, official documents, and many other settings. Notably, politeness has also been identified as an interpersonal style which can be decoupled from content (Kang and Hovy, 2019). Motivated by its central importance, in this paper we study the task of converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning.","politeness transfer : tag generate approach paper introduce new task politeness transfer involve convert non - polite sentence polite sentence preserve meaning . provide dataset 1.39 million instance automatically label politeness encourage benchmark evaluation new task . design tag generate pipeline identify stylistic attribute subsequently generate sentence target style preserve source content . politeness transfer task , model outperform state - - - art method automatic metric content preservation , comparable well performance style transfer accuracy . additionally , model surpass exist method human evaluation grammaticality , mean preservation transfer accuracy style transfer task . datum code locate https:// github.com/tag-and-generate/ introduction politeness play crucial role social interaction , closely tie power dynamic , social distance participant conversation , gender ( brown et al . , 1987 ; danescu - niculescu - mizil et al . , 2013 ) . imperative use appropriate level politeness smooth communication conversation ( coppock , 2005 ) , organizational setting like email ( peterson et al . , 2011 ) , memo , official document , setting . notably , politeness identify interpersonal style decouple content ( kang hovy , 2019 ) . motivate central importance , paper study task convert non - polite sentence polite sentence preserve meaning .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 4, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 2, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 3, 'Generation': 4, 'Information Extraction': 4, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 1, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 1, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 5, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 1, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 2, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 3, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 2, 'Speech and Multimodality': 1, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 1, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 2, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Machine Learning for NLP,False
Generation,Neural Data-to-Text Generation via Jointly Learning the Segmentation and Correspondence,"The neural attention model has achieved great success in data-to-text generation tasks. Though usually excelling at producing fluent text, it suffers from the problem of information missing, repetition and ""hallucination"". Due to the black-box nature of the neural attention architecture, avoiding these problems in a systematic way is non-trivial. To address this concern, we propose to explicitly segment target text into fragment units and align them with their data correspondences. The segmentation and correspondence are jointly learned as latent variables without any human annotations. We further impose a soft statistical constraint to regularize the segmental granularity. The resulting architecture maintains the same expressive power as neural attention models, while being able to generate fully interpretable outputs with several times less computational cost. On both E2E and WebNLG benchmarks, we show the proposed model consistently outperforms its neural attention counterparts.","Neural Data-to-Text Generation via Jointly Learning the Segmentation and Correspondence The neural attention model has achieved great success in data-to-text generation tasks.

(2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3) Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated.

Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity.

Generation,Towards Faithful Neural Table-to-Text Generation with Content-Matching Constraints,"Text generation from a knowledge base aims to translate knowledge triples to naturallanguage descriptions. Most existing methods ignore the faithfulness between a generated text description and the original table, leading to generated information that goes beyond the content of the table. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel Transformerbased generation framework to achieve the goal. The core techniques in our method to enforce faithfulness include a new table-text optimal-transport matching loss and a tabletext embedding similarity loss based on the Transformer model. Furthermore, to evaluate faithfulness, we propose a new automatic metric specialized to the table-to-text generation problem. We also provide detailed analysis on each component of our model in our experiments. Automatic and human evaluations show that our framework can significantly outperform state-of-the-art by a large margin.","Towards Faithful Neural Table-to-Text Generation with Content-Matching Constraints Text generation from a knowledge base aims to translate knowledge triples to naturallanguage descriptions.

Generation,Generating Diverse and Consistent QA pairs from Contexts with Information-Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional VAEs,"One of the most crucial challenges in question answering (QA) is the scarcity of labeled data, since it is costly to obtain question-answer (QA) pairs for a target text domain with human annotation. An alternative approach to tackle the problem is to use automatically generated QA pairs from either the problem context or from large amount of unstructured texts (e.g. Wikipedia).

Generation,Improved Natural Language Generation via Loss Truncation,"Neural language models are usually trained to match the distributional properties of largescale corpora by minimizing the log loss. While straightforward to optimize, this approach forces the model to reproduce all variations in the dataset, including noisy and invalid references (e.g., misannotations and hallucinated facts). Even a small fraction of noisy data can degrade the performance of log loss. As an alternative, prior work has shown that minimizing the distinguishability of generated samples is a principled and robust loss that can handle invalid references. However, distinguishability has not been used in practice due to challenges in optimization and estimation. We propose loss truncation: a simple and scalable procedure which adaptively removes high log loss examples as a way to optimize for distinguishability. Empirically, we demonstrate that loss truncation outperforms existing baselines on distinguishability on a summarization task.

We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new stateof-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE.

Generation,Reverse Engineering Configurations of Neural Text Generation Models,"This paper seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of neural text generations models. The study of artifacts that emerge in machine generated text as a result of modeling choices is a nascent research area. Previously, the extent and degree to which these artifacts surface in generated text has not been well studied. In the spirit of better understanding generative text models and their artifacts, we propose the new task of distinguishing which of several variants of a given model generated a piece of text, and we conduct an extensive suite of diagnostic tests to observe whether modeling choices (e.g., sampling methods, top-k probabilities, model architectures, etc.) leave detectable artifacts in the text they generate. Our key finding, which is backed by a rigorous set of experiments, is that such artifacts are present and that different modeling choices can be inferred by observing the generated text alone. This suggests that neural text generators may be more sensitive to various modeling choices than previously thought.","Reverse Engineering Configurations of Neural Text Generation Models This paper seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of neural text generations models.

Generation,Pre-train and Plug-in: Flexible Conditional Text Generation with Variational Auto-Encoders,"Conditional Text Generation has drawn much attention as a topic of Natural Language Generation (NLG) which provides the possibility for humans to control the properties of generated contents. Current conditional generation models cannot handle emerging conditions due to their joint end-to-end learning fashion. When a new condition added, these techniques require full retraining. In this paper, we present a new framework named Pre-train and Plug-in Variational Auto-Encoder (PPVAE) towards flexible conditional text generation. PPVAE decouples the text generation module from the condition representation module to allow ""one-to-many"" conditional generation. When a fresh condition emerges, only a lightweight network needs to be trained and works as a plug-in for PPVAE, which is efficient and desirable for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PPVAE against the existing alternatives with better conditionality and diversity but less training effort. 1","Pre-train and Plug-in: Flexible Conditional Text Generation with Variational Auto-Encoders Conditional Text Generation has drawn much attention as a topic of Natural Language Generation (NLG) which provides the possibility for humans to control the properties of generated contents.

Information Extraction,Relabel the Noise: Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations via Cooperative Multiagents,"Distant supervision based methods for entity and relation extraction have received increasing popularity due to the fact that these methods require light human annotation efforts. In this paper, we consider the problem of shifted label distribution, which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set, and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. We propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents.

In this paper, we consider the problem of shifted label distribution, which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set, and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. We propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents.

Information Extraction,Exploiting the Syntax-Model Consistency for Neural Relation Extraction,"This paper studies the task of Relation Extraction (RE) that aims to identify the semantic relations between two entity mentions in text. In the deep learning models for RE, it has been beneficial to incorporate the syntactic structures from the dependency trees of the input sentences. In such models, the dependency trees are often used to directly structure the network architectures or to obtain the dependency relations between the word pairs to inject the syntactic information into the models via multi-task learning. The major problems with these approaches are the lack of generalization beyond the syntactic structures in the training data or the failure to capture the syntactic importance of the words for RE. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning model for RE that uses the dependency trees to extract the syntax-based importance scores for the words, serving as a tree representation to introduce syntactic information into the models with greater generalization. In particular, we leverage Ordered-Neuron Long-Short Term Memory Networks (ON-LSTM) to infer the model-based importance scores for RE for every word in the sentences that are then regulated to be consistent with the syntax-based scores to enable syntactic information injection. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on three RE benchmark datasets.","Exploiting the Syntax-Model Consistency for Neural Relation Extraction This paper studies the task of Relation Extraction (RE) that aims to identify the semantic relations between two entity mentions in text.

Information Extraction,From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues,"Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing. The NLP community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios, but little attention has been given to CS in particular. This is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data, despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. In this paper, we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. Specifically, we transfer English knowledge from a pre-trained ELMo model to different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English) using the task of language identification. Our method, CS-ELMo, is an extension of ELMo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. We show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual BERT and homologous CS-unaware ELMo models and establishing a new state of the art in CS tasks, such as NER and POS tagging. Our technique can be expanded to more English-paired code-switched languages, providing more resources to the CS community.","From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing.

Information Extraction,Named Entity Recognition without Labelled Data: A Weak Supervision Approach,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training. When in-domain labelled data is available, transfer learning techniques can be used to adapt existing NER models to the target domain. But what should one do when there is no hand-labelled data for the target domain? This paper presents a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled data through weak supervision. The approach relies on a broad spectrum of labelling functions to automatically annotate texts from the target domain. These annotations are then merged together using a hidden Markov model which captures the varying accuracies and confusions of the labelling functions. A sequence labelling model can finally be trained on the basis of this unified annotation. We evaluate the approach on two English datasets (CoNLL 2003 and news articles from Reuters and Bloomberg) and demonstrate an improvement of about 7 percentage points in entity-level F 1 scores compared to an out-of-domain neural NER model.","Named Entity Recognition without Labelled Data: A Weak Supervision Approach Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training.

Information Extraction,Single-/Multi-Source Cross-Lingual NER via Teacher-Student Learning on Unlabeled Data in Target Language,"To better tackle the named entity recognition (NER) problem on languages with little/no labeled data, cross-lingual NER must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data.

However, such methods either are not applicable if the labeled data in the source languages is unavailable, or do not leverage information contained in unlabeled data in the target language. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method to address such limitations, where NER models in the source languages are used as teachers to train a student model on unlabeled data in the target language. The proposed method works for both single-source and multi-source crosslingual NER.

In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, ONEIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. ONEIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions.

The starting point of this paper is a simple solution to this problem, in which polyglot models are fine-tuned on monolingual data to consistently and significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts. To explain this phenomena, we explore the sources of multilingual transfer in polyglot NER models and examine the weight structure of polyglot models compared to their monolingual counterparts.

We find that polyglot models efficiently share many parameters across languages and that fine-tuning may utilize a large number of those parameters.","source transfer multilingual name entity recognition name - entity inherently multilingual , annotation give language limited . motivate consider polyglot name - entity recognition ( ner ) , model train annotate datum draw language . , straightforward implementation simple idea work practice : naive training ner model annotate datum draw multiple language consistently underperform model train monolingual datum , despite have access training datum . starting point paper simple solution problem , polyglot model fine - tune monolingual datum consistently significantly outperform monolingual counterpart . explain phenomenon , explore source multilingual transfer polyglot ner model examine weight structure polyglot model compare monolingual counterpart . find polyglot model efficiently share parameter language fine - tuning utilize large number parameter .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 14, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 0, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 2, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 2, 'Student Research Workshop': 5, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 1, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Information Extraction,True
Information Extraction,Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking,"Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts. The first step of (X)EL is candidate generation, which retrieves a list of plausible candidate entities from the target-language KB for each mention. Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the realm of relatively high-resource languages, but these do not extend well to low-resource languages with few, if any, Wikipedia pages. Recently, transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in the lowresource languages by utilizing resources in closely related languages, but the performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate generation methods for low-resource XEL, then propose three improvements that (1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2) improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are simple, but effective: We experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets and find that they yield an average gain of 16.9% in TOP-30 gold candidate recall, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our improved model also yields an average gain of 7.9% in in-KB accuracy of end-to-end XEL. 1","Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts.

We believe that automatically converting medical dialogues to EMRs can greatly reduce the burdens of doctors, and extracting information from medical dialogues is an essential step. To this end, we annotate online medical consultation dialogues in a window-sliding style, which is much easier than the sequential labeling annotation.

Information Extraction,Document-Level Event Role Filler Extraction using Multi-Granularity Contextualized Encoding,"Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual sentences to make extraction decisions. This is problematic when the information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-toend neural sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context captured affects the models' performance. To dynamically aggregate information captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity (e.g., the sentence-and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show that our best system performs substantially better than prior work.

In this work, we propose a solution for ""zero-shot"" open-domain relation extraction from webpages with a previously unseen template, including from websites with little overlap with existing sources of knowledge for distant supervision and websites in entirely new subject verticals. Our model uses a graph neural network-based approach to build a rich representation of text fields on a webpage and the relationships between them, enabling generalization to new templates. Experiments show this approach provides a 31% F1 gain over a baseline for zero-shot extraction in a new subject vertical.","ZeroShotCeres: Zero-Shot Relation Extraction from Semi-Structured Webpages In many documents, such as semi-structured webpages, textual semantics are augmented with additional information conveyed using visual elements including layout, font size, and color.

Information Extraction,Neighborhood Matching Network for Entity Alignment,"Structural heterogeneity between knowledge graphs is an outstanding challenge for entity alignment. This paper presents Neighborhood Matching Network (NMN), a novel entity alignment framework for tackling the structural heterogeneity challenge. NMN estimates the similarities between entities to capture both the topological structure and the neighborhood difference. It provides two innovative components for better learning representations for entity alignment. It first uses a novel graph sampling method to distill a discriminative neighborhood for each entity. It then adopts a cross-graph neighborhood matching module to jointly encode the neighborhood difference for a given entity pair. Such strategies allow NMN to effectively construct matchingoriented entity representations while ignoring noisy neighbors that have a negative impact on the alignment task. Extensive experiments performed on three entity alignment datasets show that NMN can well estimate the neighborhood similarity in more tough cases and significantly outperforms 12 previous state-ofthe-art methods.","Neighborhood Matching Network for Entity Alignment Structural heterogeneity between knowledge graphs is an outstanding challenge for entity alignment.

Information Extraction,IMoJIE: Iterative Memory-Based Joint Open Information Extraction,"While traditional systems for Open Information Extraction were statistical and rule-based, recently neural models have been introduced for the task. Our work builds upon CopyAttention, a sequence generation OpenIE model (Cui et al., 2018) . Our analysis reveals that CopyAttention produces a constant number of extractions per sentence, and its extracted tuples often express redundant information. We present IMOJIE, an extension to Copy-Attention, which produces the next extraction conditioned on all previously extracted tuples. This approach overcomes both shortcomings of CopyAttention, resulting in a variable number of diverse extractions per sentence. We train IMOJIE on training data bootstrapped from extractions of several non-neural systems, which have been automatically filtered to reduce redundancy and noise. IMOJIE outperforms CopyAttention by about 18 F1 pts, and a BERT-based strong baseline by 2 F1 pts, establishing a new state of the art for the task.","IMoJIE: Iterative Memory-Based Joint Open Information Extraction While traditional systems for Open Information Extraction were statistical and rule-based, recently neural models have been introduced for the task.

Information Extraction,Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent Network for Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction,"Opinion entity extraction is a fundamental task in fine-grained opinion mining.

The opinion entity extraction unit and the relation detection unit are developed as two channels to extract opinion entities and relations simultaneously.

Information Extraction,Continual Relation Learning via Episodic Memory Activation and Reconsolidation,"Continual relation learning aims to continually train a model on new data to learn incessantly emerging novel relations while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old relations.

However, these memorybased methods usually suffer from overfitting the few memorized examples of old relations, which may gradually cause inevitable confusion among existing relations. Inspired by the mechanism in human long-term memory formation, we introduce episodic memory activation and reconsolidation (EMAR) to continual relation learning. Every time neural models are activated to learn both new and memorized data, EMAR utilizes relation prototypes for memory reconsolidation exercise to keep a stable understanding of old relations.

And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1.

Information Extraction,ReInceptionE: Relation-Aware Inception Network with Joint Local-Global Structural Information for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"The goal of Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to learn how to represent the lowdimensional vectors for entities and relations based on the observed triples. The conventional shallow models are limited to their expressiveness. ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018)   takes advantage of CNN and improves the expressive power with parameter efficient operators by increasing the interactions between head and relation embeddings. However, there is no structural information in the embedding space of ConvE, and the performance is still limited by the number of interactions. The recent KBGAT (Nathani et al.,  2019)  provides another way to learn embeddings by adaptively utilizing structural information. In this paper, we take the benefits of ConvE and KBGAT together and propose a Relation-aware Inception network with joint local-global structural information for knowledge graph Embedding (ReInceptionE).

The conventional shallow models are limited to their expressiveness. ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018)   takes advantage of CNN and improves the expressive power with parameter efficient operators by increasing the interactions between head and relation embeddings. However, there is no structural information in the embedding space of ConvE, and the performance is still limited by the number of interactions. The recent KBGAT (Nathani et al.,  2019)  provides another way to learn embeddings by adaptively utilizing structural information. In this paper, we take the benefits of ConvE and KBGAT together and propose a Relation-aware Inception network with joint local-global structural information for knowledge graph Embedding (ReInceptionE). Specifically, we first explore the Inception network to learn query embedding, which aims to further increase the interactions between head and relation embeddings. Then, we propose to use a relation-aware attention mechanism to enrich the query embedding with the local neighborhood and global entity information.

Information Extraction,A Two-Step Approach for Implicit Event Argument Detection,"In this work, we explore the implicit event argument detection task, which studies event arguments beyond sentence boundaries. The addition of cross-sentence argument candidates imposes great challenges for modeling. To reduce the number of candidates, we adopt a two-step approach, decomposing the problem into two sub-problems: argument head-word detection and head-to-span expansion. Evaluated on the recent RAMS dataset (Ebner et al., 2020), our model achieves overall better performance than a strong sequence labeling baseline. We further provide detailed error analysis, presenting where the model mainly makes errors and indicating directions for future improvements. It remains a challenge to detect implicit arguments, calling for more future work of document-level modeling for this task.","A Two-Step Approach for Implicit Event Argument Detection In this work, we explore the implicit event argument detection task, which studies event arguments beyond sentence boundaries.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Contextualized Weak Supervision for Text Classification,"Weakly supervised text classification based on a few user-provided seed words has recently attracted much attention from researchers. Existing methods mainly generate pseudo-labels in a context-free manner (e.g., string matching), therefore, the ambiguous, context-dependent nature of human language has been long overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ConWea, providing contextualized weak supervision for text classification. Specifically, we leverage contextualized representations of word occurrences and seed word information to automatically differentiate multiple interpretations of the same word, and thus create a contextualized corpus. This contextualized corpus is further utilized to train the classifier and expand seed words in an iterative manner. This process not only adds new contextualized, highly label-indicative keywords but also disambiguates initial seed words, making our weak supervision fully contextualized. Extensive experiments and case studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the necessity and significant advantages of using contextualized weak supervision, especially when the class labels are fine-grained.","Contextualized Weak Supervision for Text Classification Weakly supervised text classification based on a few user-provided seed words has recently attracted much attention from researchers.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Generative Semantic Hashing Enhanced via Boltzmann Machines,"Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training, existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution, enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size, independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper, to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes, we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training, we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that, an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques, the entire model can be optimized efficiently.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code, our model can achieve significant performance gains.","generative semantic hashing enhance boltzmann machines generative semantic hashing promising technique large - scale information retrieval thank fast retrieval speed small memory footprint . tractability training , exist generative - hashing method assume factorize form posterior distribution , enforce independence bit hash code . perspective model representation code space size , independence good assumption . paper , introduce correlation bit hash code , propose employ distribution boltzmann machine variational posterior . address intractability issue training , develop approximate method reparameterize distribution boltzmann machine augment hierarchical concatenation gaussian - like distribution bernoulli distribution . base , asymptotically - exact low bound derive evidence low bound ( elbo ) . novel technique , entire model optimize efficiently . extensive experimental result demonstrate effectively model correlation different bit hash code , model achieve significant performance gain .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 2, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 5, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 3, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 4, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 3, 'NLP Applications': 4, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 3, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 1, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 5, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 3, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 2, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 1, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Information Extraction,False
Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Interactive Construction of User-Centric Dictionary for Text Analytics,"We propose a methodology to construct a term dictionary for text analytics through an interactive process between a human and a machine. The interactive approach helps the creation of flexible dictionaries with precise granularity required in text analysis.

Along with the algorithm, we also design an automatic evaluation framework that provides a systematic assessment of any interactive method for the dictionary creation task.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Feature Projection for Improved Text Classification,"In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels. For example, in sentiment classification, words like good and nice are indicative of the positive sentiment and words like bad and terrible are indicative of the negative sentiment. However, there are also many common features (e.g., words) that are not indicative of any specific class (e.g., voice and screen, which are common to both sentiment classes and are not discriminative for classification). Although deep learning has made significant progresses in generating discriminative features through its powerful representation learning, we believe there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel angle to further improve this representation learning, i.e., feature projection. This method projects existing features into the orthogonal space of the common features. The resulting projection is thus perpendicular to the common features and more discriminative for classification. We apply this new method to improve CNN, RNN, Transformer, and Bert based text classification and obtain markedly better results.","Feature Projection for Improved Text Classification In classification, there are usually some good features that are indicative of class labels.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Exclusive Hierarchical Decoding for Deep Keyphrase Generation,"Keyphrase generation (KG) aims to summarize the main ideas of a document into a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce. Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover, previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of previouslypredicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity of the generated keyphrases.

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Neural Topic Modeling with Bidirectional Adversarial Training,"Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a twoway projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6% is observed in accuracy.","Neural Topic Modeling with Bidirectional Adversarial Training Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Information Retrieval and Text Mining,CluHTM - Semantic Hierarchical Topic Modeling based on CluWords,"Hierarchical Topic modeling (HTM) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration. Despite advantages over traditional topic modeling, HTM poses its own challenges, such as (1) topic incoherence, (2) unreasonable (hierarchical) structure, and (3) issues related to the definition of the ""ideal"" number of topics and depth of the hierarchy. In this paper, we advance the stateof-the-art on HTM by means of the design and evaluation of CluHTM, a novel nonprobabilistic hierarchical matrix factorization aimed at solving the specific issues of HTM. CluHTM's novel contributions include: (i) the exploration of richer text representation that encapsulates both, global (dataset level) and local semantic information -when combined, these pieces of information help to solve the topic incoherence problem as well as issues related to the unreasonable structure; (ii) the exploitation of a stability analysis metric for defining the number of topics and the ""shape"" the hierarchical structure. In our evaluation, considering twelve datasets and seven stateof-the-art baselines, CluHTM outperformed the baselines in the vast majority of the cases, with gains of around 500% over the strongest state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses of why our solution works so well.","CluHTM - Semantic Hierarchical Topic Modeling based on CluWords Hierarchical Topic modeling (HTM) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration.

A model is simulatable when a person can predict its behavior on new inputs. Through two kinds of simulation tests involving text and tabular data, we evaluate five explanations methods: (1) LIME, (2) Anchor, (3) Decision Boundary, (4) a Prototype model, and (5) a Composite approach that combines explanations from each method. Clear evidence of method effectiveness is found in very few cases: LIME improves simulatability in tabular classification, and our Prototype method is effective in counterfactual simulation tests. We also collect subjective ratings of explanations, but we do not find that ratings are predictive of how helpful explanations are. Our results provide the first reliable and comprehensive estimates of how explanations influence simulatability across a variety of explanation methods and data domains. We show that (1) we need to be careful about the metrics we use to evaluate explanation methods, and (2) there is significant room for improvement in current methods. 1","Evaluating Explainable AI: Which Algorithmic Explanations Help Users Predict Model Behavior?

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,An Analysis of the Utility of Explicit Negative Examples to Improve the Syntactic Abilities of Neural Language Models,"We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models. Negative examples here are incorrect words in a sentence, such as barks in *The dogs barks. Neural language models are commonly trained only on positive examples, a set of sentences in the training data, but recent studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In this paper, we first demonstrate that appropriately using negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement) will boost the model's robustness on them in English, with a negligible loss of perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level of subjectrelative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions.","An Analysis of the Utility of Explicit Negative Examples to Improve the Syntactic Abilities of Neural Language Models We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Roles and Utilization of Attention Heads in Transformer-based Neural Language Models,"Sentence encoders based on the transformer architecture have shown promising results on various natural language tasks. The main impetus lies in the pre-trained neural language models that capture long-range dependencies among words, owing to multi-head attention that is unique in the architecture. However, little is known for how linguistic properties are processed, represented, and utilized for downstream tasks among hundreds of attention heads inside the pre-trained transformerbased model. For the initial goal of examining the roles of attention heads in handling a set of linguistic features, we conducted a set of experiments with ten probing tasks and three downstream tasks on four pre-trained transformer families (GPT, GPT2, BERT, and ELECTRA). Meaningful insights are shown through the lens of heat map visualization and utilized to propose a relatively simple sentence representation method that takes advantage of most influential attention heads, resulting in additional performance improvements on the downstream tasks.","Roles and Utilization of Attention Heads in Transformer-based Neural Language Models Sentence encoders based on the transformer architecture have shown promising results on various natural language tasks.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Compositionality and Generalization In Emergent Languages,"Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality. In this paper, we study whether the language emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents. We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive.","Compositionality and Generalization In Emergent Languages Natural language allows us to refer to novel composite concepts by combining expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property known as compositionality.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Generating Hierarchical Explanations on Text Classification via Feature Interaction Detection,"Generating explanations for neural networks has become crucial for their applications in real-world with respect to reliability and trustworthiness.

Such explanations visualize how words and phrases are combined at different levels of the hierarchy, which can help users understand the decision-making of blackbox models. The proposed method is evaluated with three neural text classifiers (LSTM, CNN, and BERT) on two benchmark datasets, via both automatic and human evaluations.

We manipulate two factors that can affect the outcome of analysis. First, we investigate the role of learning by comparing neural activations extracted from trained versus randomly-initialized models. Second, we examine the temporal scope of the activations by probing both local activations corresponding to a few milliseconds of the speech signal, and global activations pooled over the whole utterance.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Towards Transparent and Explainable Attention Models,"Recent studies on interpretability of attention distributions have led to notions of faithful and plausible explanations for a model's predictions. Attention distributions can be considered a faithful explanation if a higher attention weight implies a greater impact on the model's prediction. They can be considered a plausible explanation if they provide a humanunderstandable justification for the model's predictions. In this work, we first explain why current attention mechanisms in LSTM based encoders can neither provide a faithful nor a plausible explanation of the model's predictions. We observe that in LSTM based encoders the hidden representations at different time-steps are very similar to each other (high conicity) and attention weights in these situations do not carry much meaning because even a random permutation of the attention weights does not affect the model's predictions. Based on experiments on a wide variety of tasks and datasets, we observe attention distributions often attribute the model's predictions to unimportant words such as punctuation and fail to offer a plausible explanation for the predictions. To make attention mechanisms more faithful and plausible, we propose a modified LSTM cell with a diversity-driven training objective that ensures that the hidden representations learned at different time steps are diverse. We show that the resulting attention distributions offer more transparency as they (i) provide a more precise importance ranking of the hidden states (ii) are better indicative of words important for the model's predictions (iii) correlate better with gradient-based attribution methods. Human evaluations indicate that the attention distributions learned by our model offer a plausible explanation of the model's predictions.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Rationalizing Text Matching: Learning Sparse Alignments via Optimal Transport,"Selecting input features of top relevance has become a popular method for building selfexplaining models. In this work, we extend this selective rationalization approach to text matching, where the goal is to jointly select and align text pieces, such as tokens or sentences, as a justification for the downstream prediction. Our approach employs optimal transport (OT) to find a minimal cost alignment between the inputs. However, directly applying OT often produces dense and therefore uninterpretable alignments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce novel constrained variants of the OT problem that result in highly sparse alignments with controllable sparsity. Our model is end-to-end differentiable using the Sinkhorn algorithm for OT and can be trained without any alignment annotations.

Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models that share the same training data.

In some settings, faithfulness may be critical to ensure transparency. Lei et al.

However, the discrete selection over input tokens performed by this method complicates training, leading to high variance and requiring careful hyperparameter tuning. We propose a simpler variant of this approach that provides faithful explanations by construction. In our scheme, named FRESH, arbitrary feature importance scores (e.g., gradients from a trained model) are used to induce binary labels over token inputs, which an extractor can be trained to predict.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,"The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much these networks actually ""know"" about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten typologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research-plus Englishtotalling eleven languages.

If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten typologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research-plus Englishtotalling eleven languages.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Spying on Your Neighbors: Fine-grained Probing of Contextual Embeddings for Information about Surrounding Words,"Although models using contextual word embeddings have achieved state-of-the-art results on a host of NLP tasks, little is known about exactly what information these embeddings encode about the context words that they are understood to reflect.

We apply these tasks to examine the popular BERT, ELMo and GPT contextual encoders, and find that each of our tested information types is indeed encoded as contextual information across tokens, often with nearperfect recoverability-but the encoders vary in which features they distribute to which tokens, how nuanced their distributions are, and how robust the encoding of each feature is to distance.

Sources of Hierarchical Inductive Bias in Sequence-to-Sequence Networks,"Learners that are exposed to the same training data might generalize differently due to differing inductive biases. In neural network models, inductive biases could in theory arise from any aspect of the model architecture. We investigate which architectural factors affect the generalization behavior of neural sequence-to-sequence models trained on two syntactic tasks, English question formation and English tense reinflection. For both tasks, the training set is consistent with a generalization based on hierarchical structure and a generalization based on linear order. All architectural factors that we investigated qualitatively affected how models generalized, including factors with no clear connection to hierarchical structure. For example, LSTMs and GRUs displayed qualitatively different inductive biases. However, the only factor that consistently contributed a hierarchical bias across tasks was the use of a treestructured model rather than a model with sequential recurrence, suggesting that humanlike syntactic generalization requires architectural syntactic structure.","Does Syntax Need to Grow on Trees?

Further, errors cannot be properly attributed to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other exceptional faults. We introduce influence paths, a causal account of structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the subsequent verb) into a set of gate-level or neuron-level paths. The set localizes and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g., attractors). We exemplify the methodology on a widely-studied multi-layer LSTM language model, demonstrating its accounting for subject-verb number agreement.

We analyze two state of the art models with LSTM and Transformer architectures, respectively, using probe tasks on a coreference annotated corpus. Our hypothesis is that language models will capture grammatical properties of anaphora (such as agreement between a pronoun and its antecedent), but not semantico-referential information (the fact that pronoun and antecedent refer to the same entity). Instead, we find evidence that models capture referential aspects to some extent -though they are still much better at grammar. The Transformer outperforms the LSTM in all analyses, and exhibits in particular better semantico-referential abilities.","Probing for Referential Information in Language Models Language models keep track of complex linguistic information about the preceding context -including, e.g., syntactic relations in a sentence.

Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP,Understanding Attention for Text Classification,"Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, many researchers started to investigate the interpretability of attention on NLP tasks. Many existing approaches focused on examining whether the local attention weights could reflect the importance of input representations. In this work, we present a study on understanding the internal mechanism of attention by looking into the gradient update process, checking its behavior when approaching a local minimum during training. We propose to analyze for each word token the following two quantities: its polarity score and its attention score, where the latter is a global assessment on the token's significance. We discuss conditions under which the attention mechanism may become more (or less) interpretable, and show how the interplay between the two quantities may impact the model performance. 1","Understanding Attention for Text Classification Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

To address this issue, recent bias mitigation methods for VQA propose to incorporate visual cues (e.g., human attention maps) to better ground the VQA models, showcasing impressive gains. However, we show that the performance improvements are not a result of improved visual grounding, but a regularization effect which prevents over-fitting to linguistic priors. For instance, we find that it is not actually necessary to provide proper, humanbased cues; random, insensible cues also result in similar improvements. Based on this observation, we propose a simpler regularization scheme that does not require any external annotations and yet achieves near state-of-theart performance on VQA-CPv2 1 .","A negative case analysis of visual grounding methods for VQA Existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) methods tend to exploit dataset biases and spurious statistical correlations, instead of producing right answers for the right reasons.

In this paper, we study how an agent can navigate long paths when learning from a corpus that consists of shorter ones. We show that existing state-of-the-art agents do not generalize well. To this end, we propose BabyWalk, a new VLN agent that is learned to navigate by decomposing long instructions into shorter ones (BabySteps) and completing them sequentially. A special design memory buffer is used by the agent to turn its past experiences into contexts for future steps. The learning process is composed of two phases. In the first phase, the agent uses imitation learning from demonstration to accomplish BabySteps. In the second phase, the agent uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning to maximize rewards on navigation tasks with increasingly longer instructions. We create two new benchmark datasets (of long navigation tasks) and use them in conjunction with existing ones to examine BabyWalk's generalization ability. Empirical results show that BabyWalk achieves state-of-the-art results on several metrics, in particular, is able to follow long instructions better.

"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond",Dense-Caption Matching and Frame-Selection Gating for Temporal Localization in VideoQA,"Videos convey rich information. Dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between people/objects, and diverse multimodal events are present in a video clip. Hence, it is important to develop automated models that can accurately extract such information from videos. Answering questions on videos is one of the tasks which can evaluate such AI abilities. In this paper, we propose a video question answering model which effectively integrates multi-modal input sources and finds the temporally relevant information to answer questions. Specifically, we first employ dense image captions to help identify objects and their detailed salient regions and actions, and hence give the model useful extra information (in explicit textual format to allow easier matching) for answering questions. Moreover, our model is also comprised of duallevel attention (word/object and frame level), multi-head self/cross-integration for different sources (video and dense captions), and gates which pass more relevant information to the classifier. Finally, we also cast the frame selection problem as a multi-label classification task and introduce two loss functions, In-and-Out Frame Score Margin (IOFSM) and Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (BBCE), to better supervise the model with human importance annotations. We evaluate our model on the challenging TVQA dataset, where each of our model components provides significant gains, and our overall model outperforms the stateof-the-art by a large margin (74.09% versus 70.52%). We also present several word, object, and frame level visualization studies. 1","Dense-Caption Matching and Frame-Selection Gating for Temporal Localization in VideoQA Videos convey rich information.

Most of the existing approaches rely on a randomly initialized classifier on top of such networks. We argue that this fine-tuning procedure is sub-optimal as the pre-trained model has no prior on the specific classifier labels, while it might have already learned an intrinsic textual representation of the task. In this paper, we introduce a new scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training phase. We study commonsense reasoning tasks where the model must rank a set of hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA (Gordon et al., 2012) , Swag (Zellers et al., 2018), HellaSwag  (Zellers et al., 2019)  and CommonsenseQA  (Talmor et al., 2019)  datasets.

Moreover, when fine-tuning directly on the proposed scoring function, we show that our method provides a much more stable training phase across random restarts (e.g ×10 standard deviation reduction on COPA test accuracy) and requires less annotated data than the standard classifier approach to reach equivalent performances.","Pre-training Is (Almost) All You Need: An Application to Commonsense Reasoning Fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models has become the standard approach for solving common NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) .

Machine Learning for NLP,Orthogonal Relation Transforms with Graph Context Modeling for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Distance-based knowledge graph embeddings have shown substantial improvement on the knowledge graph link prediction task, from TransE to the latest state-of-the-art RotatE. However, complex relations such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N still remain challenging to predict. In this work, we propose a novel distance-based approach for knowledge graph link prediction. First we extend the RotatE from 2D complex domain to high dimensional space with orthogonal transforms to model relations. The orthogonal transform embedding for relations keeps the capability for modeling symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse and compositional relations while achieves better modeling capacity. Second, the graph context is integrated into distance scoring functions directly. Specifically, graph context is explicitly modeled via two directed context representations. Each node embedding in knowledge graph is augmented with two context representations, which are computed from the neighboring outgoing and incoming nodes/edges respectively. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy on the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases. Our experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two common benchmarks FB15k-237 and WNRR-18, especially on FB15k-237 which has many high in-degree nodes.

Machine Learning for NLP,Effective Estimation of Deep Generative Language Models,"Advances in variational inference enable parameterisation of probabilistic models by deep neural networks. This combines the statistical transparency of the probabilistic modelling framework with the representational power of deep learning. Yet, due to a problem known as posterior collapse, it is difficult to estimate such models in the context of language modelling effectively. We concentrate on one such model, the variational auto-encoder, which we argue is an important building block in hierarchical probabilistic models of language. This paper contributes a sober view of the problem, a survey of techniques to address it, novel techniques, and extensions to the model. To establish a ranking of techniques, we perform a systematic comparison using Bayesian optimisation and find that many techniques perform reasonably similar, given enough resources.

Machine Learning for NLP,Why Overfitting Isn't Always Bad: Retrofitting Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings to Dictionaries,"Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy. We also retrofit to both the training dictionary and a synthetic dictionary induced from CLWE, which sometimes generalizes even better on downstream tasks. Our results confirm the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary in downstream tasks and explains why BLI is a flawed CLWE evaluation.","Why Overfitting Isn't Always Bad: Retrofitting Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings to Dictionaries Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) are often evaluated on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI).

Machine Learning for NLP,Learning to Contextually Aggregate Multi-Source Supervision for Sequence Labeling,"Sequence labeling is a fundamental task for a range of natural language processing problems.

It learns individual representation for every source and dynamically aggregates source-specific knowledge by a context-aware attention module. Finally, it leads to a model reflecting the agreement (consensus) among multiple sources.

Machine Learning for NLP,Pretraining with Contrastive Sentence Objectives Improves Discourse Performance of Language Models,"Recent models for unsupervised representation learning of text have employed a number of techniques to improve contextual word representations but have put little focus on discourse-level representations. We propose CONPONO 1 , an inter-sentence objective for pretraining language models that models discourse coherence and the distance between sentences. Given an anchor sentence, our model is trained to predict the text k sentences away using a sampled-softmax objective where the candidates consist of neighboring sentences and sentences randomly sampled from the corpus. On the discourse representation benchmark DiscoEval, our model improves over the previous state-of-the-art by up to 13% and on average 4% absolute across 7 tasks. Our model is the same size as BERT-Base, but outperforms the much larger BERT-Large model and other more recent approaches that incorporate discourse. We also show that CONPONO yields gains of 2%-6% absolute even for tasks that do not explicitly evaluate discourse: textual entailment (RTE), common sense reasoning (COPA) and reading comprehension (ReCoRD).","Pretraining with Contrastive Sentence Objectives Improves Discourse Performance of Language Models Recent models for unsupervised representation learning of text have employed a number of techniques to improve contextual word representations but have put little focus on discourse-level representations.

Machine Learning for NLP,A Probabilistic Generative Model for Typographical Analysis of Early Modern Printing,"We propose a deep and interpretable probabilistic generative model to analyze glyph shapes in printed Early Modern documents.

Machine Learning for NLP,Generalized Entropy Regularization or: There's Nothing Special about Label Smoothing,"Prior work has explored directly regularizing the output distributions of probabilistic models to alleviate peaky (i.e. over-confident) predictions, a common sign of overfitting. This class of techniques, of which label smoothing is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and datasets in language generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a trained model and its performance on language generation tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparse distributions, an undesirable property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place.

We show that PLLs outperform scores from autoregressive language models like GPT-2 in a variety of tasks. By rescoring ASR and NMT hypotheses, RoBERTa reduces an endto-end LibriSpeech model's WER by 30% relative and adds up to +1.7 BLEU on state-of-theart baselines for low-resource translation pairs, with further gains from domain adaptation.

Machine Learning for NLP,SMART: Robust and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-trained Natural Language Models through Principled Regularized Optimization,"Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we propose a new learning framework for robust and efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained models to attain better generalization performance. The proposed framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the complexity of the model; 2. Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trustregion methods and can prevent aggressive updating.

Machine Learning for NLP,Posterior Calibrated Training on Sentence Classification Tasks,"Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability.

Machine Learning for NLP,Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms for Text Representation,"Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models. In conventional pooling methods such as average, max and attentive pooling, text representations are weighted summations of the L 1 or L ∞ norm of input features. However, their pooling norms are always fixed and may not be optimal for learning accurate text representations in different tasks. In addition, in many popular pooling methods such as max and attentive pooling some features may be over-emphasized, while other useful ones are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms (APLN) approach for text representation. Different from existing pooling methods that use a fixed pooling norm, we propose to learn the norm in an end-to-end manner to automatically find the optimal ones for text representation in different tasks. In addition, we propose two methods to ensure the numerical stability of the model training. The first one is scale limiting, which re-scales the input to ensure non-negativity and alleviate the risk of exponential explosion. The second one is re-formulation, which decomposes the exponent operation to avoid computing the realvalued powers of the input and further accelerate the pooling operation. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of attentive pooling.","Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms for Text Representation Pooling is an important technique for learning text representations in many neural NLP models. In conventional pooling methods such as average, max and attentive pooling, text representations are weighted summations of the L 1 or L ∞ norm of input features. However, their pooling norms are always fixed and may not be optimal for learning accurate text representations in different tasks. In addition, in many popular pooling methods such as max and attentive pooling some features may be over-emphasized, while other useful ones are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Pooling with Learnable Norms (APLN) approach for text representation. Different from existing pooling methods that use a fixed pooling norm, we propose to learn the norm in an end-to-end manner to automatically find the optimal ones for text representation in different tasks. In addition, we propose two methods to ensure the numerical stability of the model training.

Machine Learning for NLP,Robust Encodings: A Framework for Combating Adversarial Typos,"Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs. Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.","Robust Encodings: A Framework for Combating Adversarial Typos Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs.

Machine Learning for NLP,Span Selection Pre-training for Question Answering,"BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and related pre-trained Transformers have provided large gains across many language understanding tasks, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

We also show significant impact in HotpotQA, improving answer prediction F1 by 4 points and supporting fact prediction F1 by 1 point and outperforming the previous best system.

Experimental results on several representative NLP tasks, including natural language inference, semantic role labelling, and machine translation, show that SSANs consistently outperform the standard SANs.

Machine Learning for NLP,On Importance Sampling-Based Evaluation of Latent Language Models,"Language models that use additional latent structures (e.g., syntax trees, coreference chains, and knowledge graph links) provide several advantages over traditional language models.

Machine Learning for NLP,Dependency Graph Enhanced Dual-transformer Structure for Aspect-based Sentiment Classification,"Aspect-based sentiment classification is a popular task aimed at identifying the corresponding emotion of a specific aspect.

To this end, we propose a dependency graph enhanced dual-transformer network (named DGEDT) by jointly considering the flat representations learnt from Transformer and graphbased representations learnt from the corresponding dependency graph in an iterative interaction manner. Specifically, a dualtransformer structure is devised in DGEDT to support mutual reinforcement between the flat representation learning and graph-based representation learning.

Machine Learning for NLP,Pretrained Transformers Improve Out-of-Distribution Robustness,"Although pretrained Transformers such as BERT achieve high accuracy on indistribution examples, do they generalize to new distributions? We systematically measure out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for seven NLP datasets by constructing a new robustness benchmark with realistic distribution shifts. We measure the generalization of previous models including bag-of-words models, ConvNets, and LSTMs, and we show that pretrained Transformers' performance declines are substantially smaller. Pretrained transformers are also more effective at detecting anomalous or OOD examples, while many previous models are frequently worse than chance. We examine which factors affect robustness, finding that larger models are not necessarily more robust, distillation can be harmful, and more diverse pretraining data can enhance robustness.

Pretrained transformers are also more effective at detecting anomalous or OOD examples, while many previous models are frequently worse than chance.

Machine Learning for NLP,On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond,"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) combine latent variables with amortized variational inference, whose optimization usually converges into a trivial local optimum termed posterior collapse, especially in text modeling. By tracking the optimization dynamics, we observe the encoder-decoder incompatibility that leads to poor parameterizations of the data manifold. We argue that the trivial local optimum may be avoided by improving the encoder and decoder parameterizations since the posterior network is part of a transition map between them. To this end, we propose Coupled-VAE, which couples a VAE model with a deterministic autoencoder with the same structure and improves the encoder and decoder parameterizations via encoder weight sharing and decoder signal matching. We apply the proposed Coupled-VAE approach to various VAE models with different regularization, posterior family, decoder structure, and optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo) show consistently improved results in terms of probability estimation and richness of the latent space. We also generalize our method to conditional language modeling and propose Coupled-CVAE, which largely improves the diversity of dialogue generation on the Switchboard dataset. 1","On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond Variational autoencoders (VAEs) combine latent variables with amortized variational inference, whose optimization usually converges into a trivial local optimum termed posterior collapse, especially in text modeling.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction,"Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages. Recent methods are mostly based on unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings, the key to which is to find initial solutions of word translations, followed by the learning and refinement of mappings between the embedding spaces of two languages. However, previous methods find initial solutions just based on word-level information, which may be (1) limited and inaccurate, and (2) prone to contain some noise introduced by the insufficiently pre-trained embeddings of some words. To deal with those issues, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based paradigm to induce bilingual lexicons in a coarse-to-fine way. We first build a graph for each language with its vertices representing different words. Then we extract word cliques from the graphs and map the cliques of two languages. Based on that, we induce the initial word translation solution with the central words of the aligned cliques. This coarse-to-fine approach not only leverages clique-level information, which is richer and more accurate, but also effectively reduces the bad effect of the noise in the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we take the initial solution as the seed to learn cross-lingual embeddings, from which we induce bilingual lexicons. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction compared with previous methods.","A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages.

However, previous methods find initial solutions just based on word-level information, which may be (1) limited and inaccurate, and (2) prone to contain some noise introduced by the insufficiently pre-trained embeddings of some words. To deal with those issues, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based paradigm to induce bilingual lexicons in a coarse-to-fine way. We first build a graph for each language with its vertices representing different words. Then we extract word cliques from the graphs and map the cliques of two languages. Based on that, we induce the initial word translation solution with the central words of the aligned cliques. This coarse-to-fine approach not only leverages clique-level information, which is richer and more accurate, but also effectively reduces the bad effect of the noise in the pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we take the initial solution as the seed to learn cross-lingual embeddings, from which we induce bilingual lexicons. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction compared with previous methods.","graph - base coarse - - fine method unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction task induce word translation monolingual corpus language . recent method base unsupervised cross - lingual word embedding , key find initial solution word translation , follow learning refinement mapping embedding space language . , previous method find initial solution base word - level information , ( 1 ) limited inaccurate , ( 2 ) prone contain noise introduce insufficiently pre - train embedding word . deal issue , paper , propose novel graph - base paradigm induce bilingual lexicon coarse - - fine way . build graph language vertex represent different word . extract word clique graph map clique language . base , induce initial word translation solution central word align clique . coarse - - fine approach leverage clique - level information , rich accurate , effectively reduce bad effect noise pre - trained embedding . finally , initial solution seed learn cross - lingual embedding , induce bilingual lexicon . experiment approach improve performance bilingual lexicon induction compare previous method .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 4, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 11, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 3, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 4, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 1, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 10, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 4, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 2, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 1, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Machine Learning for NLP,False
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Unsupervised Domain Clusters in Pretrained Language Models,"The notion of ""in-domain data"" in NLP is often over-simplistic and vague, as textual data varies in many nuanced linguistic aspects such as topic, style or level of formality. In addition, domain labels are many times unavailable, making it challenging to build domainspecific systems.

We harness this property and propose domain data selection methods based on such models, which require only a small set of in-domain monolingual data. We evaluate our data selection methods for neural machine translation across five diverse domains, where they outperform an established approach as measured by both BLEU and by precision and recall of sentence selection with respect to an oracle.","Unsupervised Domain Clusters in Pretrained Language Models The notion of ""in-domain data"" in NLP is often over-simplistic and vague, as textual data varies in many nuanced linguistic aspects such as topic, style or level of formality.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Norm-Based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation,"A neural machine translation (NMT) system is expensive to train, especially with highresource settings. As the NMT architectures become deeper and wider, this issue gets worse and worse.

We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks.

Specifically, we first empirically study the functionalities of the encoder and the decoder in NAT models, and find that the encoder takes a more important role than the decoder regarding the translation quality. Therefore, we propose to train the encoder more rigorously by masking the encoder input while training.

This twolevel sampling procedure gives NMT performance gains over sequence MRT and maximum-likelihood training. We demonstrate that training is more robust for document-level metrics than with sequence metrics.

Our experiments on a dataset with English translated to and from twelve other languages (including three language families and six language branches) show remarkable results, surpassing strong unsupervised individual baselines while achieving promising performance between non-English language pairs in zero-shot translation scenarios and alleviating poor performance in low-resource language pairs.","knowledge distillation multilingual unsupervised neural machine translation unsupervised neural machine translation ( unmt ) recently achieve remarkable result language pair . , translate single language pair produce translation result multiple language pair time . , research multilingual unmt limit . paper , empirically introduce simple method translate thirteen language single encoder single decoder , make use multilingual datum improve unmt language pair . basis empirical finding , propose knowledge distillation method enhance multilingual unmt performance . experiment dataset english translate language ( include language family language branch ) remarkable result , surpass strong unsupervised individual baseline achieve promising performance non - english language pair zero - shot translation scenario alleviate poor performance low - resource language pair .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 0, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 15, 'NLP Applications': 2, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 3, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 1, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 1, 'Theme': 1, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Machine Translation and Multilinguality,True
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Language-aware Interlingua for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) has led to impressive accuracy improvements in low-resource scenarios by sharing common linguistic information across languages. However, the traditional multilingual model fails to capture the diversity and specificity of different languages, resulting in inferior performance compared with individual models that are sufficiently trained.

The interlingual network enables the model to learn a language-independent representation from the semantic spaces of different languages, while still allowing for language-specific specialization of a particular language-pair.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Evaluating Explanation Methods for Neural Machine Translation,"Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods. Word Alignment Error Rate can be used as such a metric that matches human understanding, however, it can not measure explanation methods on those target words that are not aligned to any source word. This paper thereby makes an initial attempt to evaluate explanation methods from an alternative viewpoint. To this end, it proposes a principled metric based on fidelity in regard to the predictive behavior of the NMT model. As the exact computation for this metric is intractable, we employ an efficient approach as its approximation. On six standard translation tasks, we quantitatively evaluate several explanation methods in terms of the proposed metric and we reveal some valuable findings for these explanation methods in our experiments.","Evaluating Explanation Methods for Neural Machine Translation Recently many efforts have been devoted to interpreting the black-box NMT models, but little progress has been made on metrics to evaluate explanation methods.

(ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics?

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Location Attention for Extrapolation to Longer Sequences,"Neural networks are surprisingly good at interpolating and perform remarkably well when the training set examples resemble those in the test set. However, they are often unable to extrapolate patterns beyond the seen data, even when the abstractions required for such patterns are simple. In this paper, we first review the notion of extrapolation, why it is important, and how one could hope to tackle it. We then focus on a specific type of extrapolation, which is especially useful for natural language processing: generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,BPE-Dropout: Simple and Effective Subword Regularization,"Subword segmentation is widely used to address the open vocabulary problem in machine translation. The dominant approach to subword segmentation is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which keeps the most frequent words intact while splitting the rare ones into multiple tokens.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Tagged Back-translation Revisited: Why Does It Really Work?,"In this paper, we show that neural machine translation (NMT) systems trained on large back-translated data overfit some of the characteristics of machine-translated texts. Such NMT systems better translate humanproduced translations, i.e., translationese, but may largely worsen the translation quality of original texts. Our analysis reveals that adding a simple tag to back-translations prevents this quality degradation and improves on average the overall translation quality by helping the NMT system to distinguish back-translated data from original parallel data during training. We also show that, in contrast to high-resource configurations, NMT systems trained in lowresource settings are much less vulnerable to overfit back-translations. We conclude that the back-translations in the training data should always be tagged especially when the origin of the text to be translated is unknown.","Tagged Back-translation Revisited: Why Does It Really Work?

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Reducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation Problem,"Training data for NLP tasks often exhibits gender bias in that fewer sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al., 2019) . Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a 'balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch. A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is 'catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a latticerescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al.

Furthermore, we confirm that the parameter's initial sign and not its specific value is the primary factor for successful training, and show that magnitude pruning cannot be used to find winning lottery tickets.","successfully apply stabilize lottery ticket hypothesis transformer architecture sparse model require memory storage enable fast inference reduce necessary number flop . relevant time - critical - device computation neural network . stabilize lottery ticket hypothesis state network prune training iteration , mask compute base unpruned converge model . transformer architecture wmt 2014 english→german english→french task , stabilize lottery ticket pruning perform similar magnitude pruning sparsity level 85 % , propose new combination pruning technique outperform technique high level sparsity . furthermore , confirm parameter initial sign specific value primary factor successful training , magnitude pruning find win lottery ticket .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 0, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 4, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 2, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 0, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}","Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",False
Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Balancing Training for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"When training multilingual machine translation (MT) models that can translate to/from multiple languages, we are faced with imbalanced training sets: some languages have much more training data than others.

In this paper, we propose a method that instead automatically learns how to weight training data through a data scorer that is optimized to maximize performance on all test languages.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,Learning Source Phrase Representations for Neural Machine Translation,"The Transformer translation model (Vaswani et al., 2017) based on a multi-head attention mechanism can be computed effectively in parallel and has significantly pushed forward the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

Considering that modeling phrases instead of words has significantly improved the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach through the use of larger translation blocks (""phrases"") and its reordering ability, modeling NMT at phrase level is an intuitive proposal to help the model capture long-distance relationships.

Machine Translation and Multilinguality,On the Limitations of Cross-lingual Encoders as Exposed by Reference-Free Machine Translation Evaluation,"Evaluation of cross-lingual encoders is usually performed either via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in supervised downstream tasks or via unsupervised cross-lingual textual similarity. In this paper, we concern ourselves with reference-free machine translation (MT) evaluation where we directly compare source texts to (sometimes low-quality) system translations, which represents a natural adversarial setup for multilingual encoders. Referencefree evaluation holds the promise of web-scale comparison of MT systems. We systematically investigate a range of metrics based on state-of-the-art cross-lingual semantic representations obtained with pretrained M-BERT and LASER. We find that they perform poorly as semantic encoders for reference-free MT evaluation and identify their two key limitations, namely, (a) a semantic mismatch between representations of mutual translations and, more prominently, (b) the inability to punish ""translationese"", i.e., low-quality literal translations. We propose two partial remedies: (1) post-hoc re-alignment of the vector spaces and (2) coupling of semantic-similarity based metrics with target-side language modeling. In segment-level MT evaluation, our best metric surpasses reference-based BLEU by 5.7 correlation points. We make our MT evaluation code available. 1","On the Limitations of Cross-lingual Encoders as Exposed by Reference-Free Machine Translation Evaluation Evaluation of cross-lingual encoders is usually performed either via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in supervised downstream tasks or via unsupervised cross-lingual textual similarity.

NLP Applications,Hiring Now: A Skill-Aware Multi-Attention Model for Job Posting Generation,"Writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process, but the task is often more difficult than many people think. It is challenging to specify the level of education, experience, relevant skills per the company information and job description. To this end, we propose a novel task of Job Posting Generation (JPG) that is cast as a conditional text generation problem to generate job requirements according to the job descriptions. To deal with this task, we devise a data-driven global Skill-Aware Multi-Attention generation model, named SAMA. Specifically, to model the complex mapping relationships between input and output, we design a hierarchical decoder that we first label the job description with multiple skills, then we generate a complete text guided by the skill labels. At the same time, to exploit the prior knowledge about the skills, we further construct a skill knowledge graph to capture the global prior knowledge of skills and refine the generated results. The proposed approach is evaluated on real-world job posting data. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method 1 .","Hiring Now: A Skill-Aware Multi-Attention Model for Job Posting Generation Writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process, but the task is often more difficult than many people think.

NLP Applications,A Girl Has A Name: Detecting Authorship Obfuscation,"Authorship attribution aims to identify the author of a text based on the stylometric analysis. Authorship obfuscation, on the other hand, aims to protect against authorship attribution by modifying a text's style. In this paper, we evaluate the stealthiness of state-of-the-art authorship obfuscation methods under an adversarial threat model. An obfuscator is stealthy to the extent an adversary finds it challenging to detect whether or not a text modified by the obfuscator is obfuscated -a decision that is key to the adversary interested in authorship attribution. We show that the existing authorship obfuscation methods are not stealthy as their obfuscated texts can be identified with an average F1 score of 0.87. The reason for the lack of stealthiness is that these obfuscators degrade text smoothness, as ascertained by neural language models, in a detectable manner.

NLP Applications,Toxicity Detection: Does Context Really Matter?,"Moderation is crucial to promoting healthy online discussions. Although several 'toxicity' detection datasets and models have been published, most of them ignore the context of the posts, implicitly assuming that comments may be judged independently. We investigate this assumption by focusing on two questions: (a) does context affect the human judgement, and (b) does conditioning on context improve performance of toxicity detection systems? We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title. We find that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts. Moreover, a small but significant subset of manually labeled posts (5% in one of our experiments) end up having the opposite toxicity labels if the annotators are not provided with context. Surprisingly, we also find no evidence that context actually improves the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried a range of classifiers and mechanisms to make them context aware.

NLP Applications,Language to Network: Conditional Parameter Adaptation with Natural Language Descriptions,"Transfer learning using ImageNet pre-trained models has been the de facto approach in a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, fine-tuning still requires task-specific training data. In this paper, we propose N 3 (Neural Networks from Natural Language) -a new paradigm of synthesizing task-specific neural networks from language descriptions and a generic pre-trained model. N 3 leverages language descriptions to generate parameter adaptations as well as a new task-specific classification layer for a pre-trained neural network, effectively ""fine-tuning"" the network for a new task using only language descriptions as input. To the best of our knowledge, N 3 is the first method to synthesize entire neural networks from natural language. Experimental results show that N 3 can out-perform previous natural-language based zero-shot learning methods across 4 different zero-shot image classification benchmarks.

NLP Applications,Fine-grained Interest Matching for Neural News Recommendation,"Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to improve users' online news reading experience. The core of news recommendation is accurate matching between user's interests and candidate news. The same user usually has diverse interests that are reflected in different news she has browsed. Meanwhile, important semantic features of news are implied in text segments of different granularities. Existing studies generally represent each user as a single vector and then match the candidate news vector, which may lose fine-grained information for recommendation. In this paper, we propose FIM, a Finegrained Interest Matching method for neural news recommendation. Instead of aggregating user's all historical browsed news into a unified vector, we hierarchically construct multilevel representations for each news via stacked dilated convolutions. Then we perform finegrained matching between segment pairs of each browsed news and the candidate news at each semantic level. High-order salient signals are then identified by resembling the hierarchy of image recognition for final click prediction. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from MSN news validate the effectiveness of our model on news recommendation.","Fine-grained Interest Matching for Neural News Recommendation Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to improve users' online news reading experience.

NLP Applications,Graph Neural News Recommendation with Unsupervised Preference Disentanglement,"With the explosion of news information, personalized news recommendation has become very important for users to quickly find their interested contents. Most existing methods usually learn the representations of users and news from news contents for recommendation.

In this paper, we model the usernews interactions as a bipartite graph and propose a novel Graph Neural News Recommendation model with Unsupervised Preference Disentanglement, named GNUD. Our model can encode high-order relationships into user and news representations by information propagation along the graph. Furthermore, the learned representations are disentangled with latent preference factors by a neighborhood routing algorithm, which can enhance expressiveness and interpretability. A preference regularizer is also designed to force each disentangled subspace to independently reflect an isolated preference, improving the quality of the disentangled representations.

First, hyperbolic capsules are designed to capture fine-grained document information for each label, which has the ability to characterize complicated structures among labels and documents.

NLP Applications,Spelling Error Correction with Soft-Masked BERT,"Spelling error correction is an important yet challenging task because a satisfactory solution of it essentially needs human-level language understanding ability. Without loss of generality we consider Chinese spelling error correction (CSC) in this paper. A state-ofthe-art method for the task selects a character from a list of candidates for correction (including non-correction) at each position of the sentence on the basis of BERT, the language representation model. The accuracy of the method can be sub-optimal, however, because BERT does not have sufficient capability to detect whether there is an error at each position, apparently due to the way of pre-training it using mask language modeling. In this work, we propose a novel neural architecture to address the aforementioned issue, which consists of a network for error detection and a network for error correction based on BERT, with the former being connected to the latter with what we call soft-masking technique.

We consider one example of this, concept linking, which seeks to link mentions of medical concepts to a medical concept ontology.

Using a collection of 1016 basic concept words across 106 languages, we demonstrate a very strong negative correlation of −0.74 between bits per phoneme and the average length of words.","phonotactic complexity trade - off present method calculate measure phonotactic complexity - bit phonemethat permit straightforward cross - linguistic comparison . give word , represent sequence phonemic segment symbol international phonetic alphabet , statistical model train sample word type language , approximately measure bit phoneme negative log - probability word model . simple measure allow compare entropy language , give insight complex language phonotactics . collection 1016 basic concept word 106 language , demonstrate strong negative correlation −0.74 bit phoneme average length word .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 1, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 2, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 1, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 0, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 5, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 0, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Semantics: Lexical Semantics,False
"Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation",A Multitask Learning Approach for Diacritic Restoration,"In many languages like Arabic, diacritics are used to specify pronunciations as well as meanings. Such diacritics are often omitted in written text, increasing the number of possible pronunciations and meanings for a word. This results in a more ambiguous text making computational processing on such text more difficult. Diacritic restoration is the task of restoring missing diacritics in the written text. Most state-of-the-art diacritic restoration models are built on character level information which helps generalize the model to unseen data, but presumably lose useful information at the word level. Thus, to compensate for this loss, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to jointly optimize diacritic restoration with related NLP problems namely word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic diacritization. We use Arabic as a case study since it has sufficient data resources for tasks that we consider in our joint modeling.

We know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender-which, as we quantitatively verify, can itself share information with declension class-so we also control for gender. We find for two Indo-European languages (Czech and German) that form and meaning share a significant amount of information with class (and contribute additional information beyond gender).

Question Answering,A Frame-based Sentence Representation for Machine Reading Comprehension,"Sentence representation (SR) is the most crucial and challenging task in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). MRC systems typically only utilize the information contained in the sentence itself, while human beings can leverage their semantic knowledge. To bridge the gap, we proposed a novel Frame-based Sentence Representation (FSR) method, which employs frame semantic knowledge to facilitate sentence modelling. Specifically, different from existing methods that only model lexical units (LUs), Frame Representation Models, which utilize both LUs in frame and Frame-to-Frame (F-to-F) relations, are designed to model frames and sentences with attention schema.

In this paper, we provide an indepth analysis of this dataset and the clinical reading comprehension (CliniRC) task. From our qualitative analysis, we find that (i) emrQA answers are often incomplete, and (ii) emrQA questions are often answerable without using domain knowledge. From our quantitative experiments, surprising results include that (iii) using a small sampled subset (5%-20%), we can obtain roughly equal performance compared to the model trained on the entire dataset, (iv) this performance is close to human expert's performance, and (v) BERT models do not beat the best performing base model. Following our analysis of the emrQA, we further explore two desired aspects of CliniRC systems: the ability to utilize clinical domain knowledge and to generalize to unseen questions and contexts. We argue that both should be considered when creating future datasets. 1","Clinical Reading Comprehension: A Thorough Analysis of the emrQA Dataset Machine reading comprehension has made great progress in recent years owing to largescale annotated datasets.

Question Answering,RikiNet: Reading Wikipedia Pages for Natural Question Answering,"Reading long documents to answer opendomain questions remains challenging in natural language understanding. In this paper, we introduce a new model, called RikiNet, which reads Wikipedia pages for natural question answering. RikiNet contains a dynamic paragraph dual-attention reader and a multi-level cascaded answer predictor. The reader dynamically represents the document and question by utilizing a set of complementary attention mechanisms. The representations are then fed into the predictor to obtain the span of the short answer, the paragraph of the long answer, and the answer type in a cascaded manner. On the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, a single RikiNet achieves 74.3 F1 and 57.9 F1 on longanswer and short-answer tasks. To our best knowledge, it is the first single model that outperforms the single human performance. Furthermore, an ensemble RikiNet obtains 76.1 F1 and 61.3 F1 on long-answer and shortanswer tasks, achieving the best performance on the official NQ leaderboard 1 .","RikiNet: Reading Wikipedia Pages for Natural Question Answering Reading long documents to answer opendomain questions remains challenging in natural language understanding.

Question Answering,Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension,"In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer. State-of-the-art models tend to use a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to encode the joint contextual information of document and question. However, these transformer-based models can only take a fixed-length (e.g., 512) text as its input. To deal with even longer text inputs, previous approaches usually chunk them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each segment independently without considering the information from other segments. As a result, they may form segments that fail to cover the correct answer span or retain insufficient contexts around it, which significantly degrades the performance. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need cross-segment information. We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next segment that it wants to process in either direction. We also employ recurrent mechanisms to enable information to flow across segments. Experiments on three MRC datasets -CoQA, QuAC, and TriviaQA -demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed recurrent chunking mechanisms: we can obtain segments that are more likely to contain complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the ground truth answers for better predictions.","Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer.

Question Answering,Selective Question Answering under Domain Shift,"To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering. Moreover, users often ask questions that diverge from the model's training data, making errors more likely and thus abstention more critical. In this work, we propose the setting of selective question answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a mixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain on) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuADtrained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy.","Selective Question Answering under Domain Shift To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering.

In this work, we propose the setting of selective question answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a mixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain on) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuADtrained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy.","selective question answering domain shift avoid give wrong answer , question answer ( qa ) model need know abstain answer . , user ask question diverge model training datum , make error likely abstention critical . work , propose setting selective question answering domain shift , qa model test mixture - domain - - domain datum , answer ( i.e. , abstain ) question possible maintain high accuracy . abstention policy base solely model softmax probability fare poorly , model overconfident - - domain input . instead , train calibrator identify input qa model err , abstain predict error likely . crucially , calibrator benefit observe model behavior - - domain datum , different domain test datum . combine method squadtrained qa model evaluate mixture squad qa dataset . method answer 56 % question maintain 80 % accuracy ; contrast , directly model probability answer 48 % 80 % accuracy .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 1, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 1, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 0, 'Question Answering': 26, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 1, 'Theme': 0, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Question Answering,True
Question Answering,Template-Based Question Generation from Retrieved Sentences for Improved Unsupervised Question Answering,"Question Answering (QA) is in increasing demand as the amount of information available online and the desire for quick access to this content grows. A common approach to QA has been to fine-tune a pretrained language model on a task-specific labeled dataset. This paradigm, however, relies on scarce, and costly to obtain, large-scale human-labeled data. We propose an unsupervised approach to training QA models with generated pseudotraining data. We show that generating questions for QA training by applying a simple template on a related, retrieved sentence rather than the original context sentence improves downstream QA performance by allowing the model to learn more complex context-question relationships. Training a QA model on this data gives a relative improvement over a previous unsupervised model in F1 score on the SQuAD dataset by about 14%, and 20% when the answer is a named entity, achieving stateof-the-art performance on SQuAD for unsupervised QA.","Template-Based Question Generation from Retrieved Sentences for Improved Unsupervised Question Answering Question Answering (QA) is in increasing demand as the amount of information available online and the desire for quick access to this content grows.

Experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local, discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. The blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each other's context. Furthermore, through ablations, we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging.

Question Answering,A Methodology for Creating Question Answering Corpora Using Inverse Data Annotation,"In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data. For this, we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database called Operation Trees (OT). This representation allows us to invert the annotation process without losing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our corpus is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to increase the performance significantly.","A Methodology for Creating Question Answering Corpora Using Inverse Data Annotation In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data.

In this paper, we introduce a new follow-up question identification task. We propose a three-way attentive pooling network that determines the suitability of a follow-up question by capturing pair-wise interactions between the associated passage, the conversation history, and a candidate follow-up question.

Question Answering,Harvesting and Refining Question-Answer Pairs for Unsupervised QA,"Question Answering (QA) has shown great success thanks to the availability of largescale datasets and the effectiveness of neural models. Recent research works have attempted to extend these successes to the settings with few or no labeled data available. In this work, we introduce two approaches to improve unsupervised QA. First, we harvest lexically and syntactically divergent questions from Wikipedia to automatically construct a corpus of question-answer pairs (named as REFQA). Second, we take advantage of the QA model to extract more appropriate answers, which iteratively refines data over RE-FQA. We conduct experiments 1 on SQuAD 1.1, and NewsQA by fine-tuning BERT without access to manually annotated data. Our approach outperforms previous unsupervised approaches by a large margin and is competitive with early supervised models.

Question Answering,The Cascade Transformer: an Application for Efficient Answer Sentence Selection,"Large transformer-based language models have been shown to be very effective in many classification tasks. However, their computational complexity prevents their use in applications requiring the classification of a large set of candidates. While previous works have investigated approaches to reduce model size, relatively little attention has been paid to techniques to improve batch throughput during inference. In this paper, we introduce the Cascade Transformer, a simple yet effective technique to adapt transformer-based models into a cascade of rankers. Each ranker is used to prune a subset of candidates in a batch, thus dramatically increasing throughput at inference time. Partial encodings from the transformer model are shared among rerankers, providing further speed-up. When compared to a state-of-the-art transformer model, our approach reduces computation by 37% with almost no impact on accuracy, as measured on two English Question Answering datasets.","The Cascade Transformer: an Application for Efficient Answer Sentence Selection Large transformer-based language models have been shown to be very effective in many classification tasks.

Question Answering,Benefits of Intermediate Annotations in Reading Comprehension,"Complex, compositional reading comprehension datasets require performing latent sequential decisions that are learned via supervision from the final answer. A large combinatorial space of possible decision paths that result in the same answer, compounded by the lack of intermediate supervision to help choose the right path, makes the learning particularly hard for this task. In this work, we study the benefits of collecting intermediate reasoning supervision along with the answer during data collection. We find that these intermediate annotations can provide two-fold benefits. First, we observe that for any collection budget, spending a fraction of it on intermediate annotations results in improved model performance, for two complex compositional datasets: DROP and Quoref. Second, these annotations encourage the model to learn the correct latent reasoning steps, helping combat some of the biases introduced during the data collection process.","Benefits of Intermediate Annotations in Reading Comprehension Complex, compositional reading comprehension datasets require performing latent sequential decisions that are learned via supervision from the final answer.

Question Answering,Enhancing Answer Boundary Detection for Multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension,"Multilingual pre-trained models could leverage the training data from a rich source language (such as English) to improve the performance on low resource languages. However, the transfer effectiveness on the multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task is substantially poorer than that for sentence classification tasks, mainly due to the requirement of MRC to detect the word level answer boundary. In this paper, we propose two auxiliary tasks to introduce additional phrase boundary supervision in the fine-tuning stage: (1) a mixed MRC task, which translates the question or passage to other languages and builds cross-lingual question-passage pairs; and (2) a language-agnostic knowledge masking task by leveraging knowledge phrases mined from the Web.

In addition, we introduce a more realistic information retrieval (IR) scenario where the system needs to find the answer in any of the FAQ documents. The results of an existing, strong, system show that, thanks to transfer learning from a Wikipedia QA dataset and fine tuning on a single FAQ domain, it is possible to build high quality conversational QA systems for FAQs without indomain training data.

Resources and Evaluation,Revisiting the Context Window for Cross-lingual Word Embeddings,"Existing approaches to mapping-based crosslingual word embeddings are based on the assumption that the source and target embedding spaces are structurally similar. The structures of embedding spaces largely depend on the cooccurrence statistics of each word, which the choice of context window determines.

In this work, we provide a thorough evaluation, in various languages, domains, and tasks, of bilingual embeddings trained with different context windows.

By doing so, we better understand the limitation of existing methods (i.e., what kind of knowledge cannot be effectively represented or inferred with existing methods) and shed some light on the commonsense knowledge that we need to acquire in the future for better commonsense reasoning. Moreover, to investigate whether current WSC models can understand the commonsense or they simply solve the WSC questions based on the statistical bias of the dataset, we leverage the collected reasons to develop a new task called WinoWhy, which requires models to distinguish plausible reasons from very similar but wrong reasons for all WSC questions. Experimental results prove that even though pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising progress on the original WSC dataset, they are still struggling at WinoWhy. Further experiments show that even though supervised models can achieve better performance, the performance of these models can be sensitive to the dataset distribution.

Nevertheless, little empirical work has been done on quantifying the prevalence of different syntactic divergences across language pairs.

Resources and Evaluation,Improving Image Captioning Evaluation by Considering Inter References Variance,"Evaluating image captions is very challenging partially due to the fact that there are multiple correct captions for every single image.

Resources and Evaluation,LINSPECTOR: Multilingual Probing Tasks for Word Representations,"Despite an ever-growing number of word representation models introduced for a large number of languages, there is a lack of a standardized technique to provide insights into what is captured by these models. Such insights would help the community to get an estimate of the downstream task performance, as well as to design more informed neural architectures, while avoiding extensive experimentation that requires substantial computational resources not all researchers have access to. A recent development in NLP is to use simple classification tasks, also called probing tasks, that test for a single linguistic feature such as part-of-speech.

Such insights would help the community to get an estimate of the downstream task performance, as well as to design more informed neural architectures, while avoiding extensive experimentation that requires substantial computational resources not all researchers have access to.

Resources and Evaluation,Learning and Evaluating Emotion Lexicons for 91 Languages,"Emotion lexicons describe the affective meaning of words and thus constitute a centerpiece for advanced sentiment and emotion analysis. Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

Resources and Evaluation,Not All Claims are Created Equal: Choosing the Right Statistical Approach to Assess Hypotheses,"Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues. While alternative proposals have been well-debated and adopted in other fields, they remain rarely discussed or used within the NLP community. We address this gap by contrasting various hypothesis assessment techniques, especially those not commonly used in the field (such as evaluations based on Bayesian inference). Since these statistical techniques differ in the hypotheses they can support, we argue that practitioners should first decide their target hypothesis before choosing an assessment method. This is crucial because common fallacies, misconceptions, and misinterpretation surrounding hypothesis assessment methods often stem from a discrepancy between what one would like to claim versus what the method used actually assesses.

In addition, it generalizes some popular classification (nominal scale) and error minimization (interval scale) metrics, depending on the measurement scale in which it is instantiated.","effectiveness metric ordinal classification : formal property experimental result ordinal classification task , item assign class relative ordering , positive , neutral , negative sentiment analysis . remarkably , popular evaluation metric ordinal classification task ignore relevant information ( instance , precision / recall class ignore relative ordering ) assume additional information ( instance , mean average error assume absolute distance class ) . paper propose new metric ordinal classification , closeness evaluation measure , root measurement theory information theory . theoretical analysis experimental result synthetic datum datum nlp share task indicate propose metric capture quality aspect different traditional task simultaneously . addition , generalize popular classification ( nominal scale ) error minimization ( interval scale ) metric , depend measurement scale instantiate .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 1, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 5, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 1, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 6, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 4, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 10, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 6, 'Speech and Multimodality': 1, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 2, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 2}",Resources and Evaluation,True
Resources and Evaluation,That is a Known Lie: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims,"The recent proliferation of ""fake news"" has triggered a number of responses, most notably the emergence of several manual fact-checking initiatives. As a result and over time, a large number of fact-checked claims have been accumulated, which increases the likelihood that a new claim in social media or a new statement by a politician might have already been factchecked by some trusted fact-checking organization, as viral claims often come back after a while in social media, and politicians like to repeat their favorite statements, true or false, over and over again. As manual fact-checking is very time-consuming (and fully automatic fact-checking has credibility issues), it is important to try to save this effort and to avoid wasting time on claims that have already been fact-checked. Interestingly, despite the importance of the task, it has been largely ignored by the research community so far. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we formulate the task and we discuss how it relates to, but also differs from, previous work. We further create a specialized dataset, which we release to the research community. Finally, we present learning-to-rank experiments that demonstrate sizable improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval and textual similarity approaches.","That is a Known Lie: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims The recent proliferation of ""fake news"" has triggered a number of responses, most notably the emergence of several manual fact-checking initiatives.

They struggle to achieve human-like thinking, however, because they lack the skill of iterative reasoning upon knowledge. To expose this problem in a new light, we introduce a challenge on learning from small data, PuzzLing Machines, which consists of Rosetta Stone puzzles from Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. These puzzles are carefully designed to contain only the minimal amount of parallel text necessary to deduce the form of unseen expressions. Solving them does not require external information (e.g., knowledge bases, visual signals) or linguistic expertise, but meta-linguistic awareness and deductive skills. Our challenge contains around 100 puzzles covering a wide range of linguistic phenomena from 81 languages. We show that both simple statistical algorithms and state-of-the-art deep neural models perform inadequately on this challenge, as expected. We hope that this benchmark, available at https://ukplab.github.io/ PuzzLing-Machines/, inspires further efforts towards a new paradigm in NLP-one that is grounded in human-like reasoning and understanding.","PuzzLing Machines: A Challenge on Learning From Small Data Deep neural models have repeatedly proved excellent at memorizing surface patterns from large datasets for various ML and NLP benchmarks.

Resources and Evaluation,A Recipe for Creating Multimodal Aligned Datasets for Sequential Tasks,"Many high-level procedural tasks can be decomposed into sequences of instructions that vary in their order and choice of tools. In the cooking domain, the web offers many partially-overlapping text and video recipes (i.e. procedures) that describe how to make the same dish (i.e. high-level task). Aligning instructions for the same dish across different sources can yield descriptive visual explanations that are far richer semantically than conventional textual instructions, providing commonsense insight into how real-world procedures are structured. Learning to align these different instruction sets is challenging because: a) different recipes vary in their order of instructions and use of ingredients; and b) video instructions can be noisy and tend to contain far more information than text instructions. To address these challenges, we first use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the same dish. We then use a graph algorithm to derive a joint alignment between multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish.

Resources and Evaluation,Facet-Aware Evaluation for Extractive Summarization,"Commonly adopted metrics for extractive summarization focus on lexical overlap at the token level.

To facilitate this new evaluation setup, we construct an extractive version of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and perform a thorough quantitative investigation, through which we demonstrate that facet-aware evaluation manifests better correlation with human judgment than ROUGE, enables fine-grained evaluation as well as comparative analysis, and reveals valuable insights of state-of-the-art summarization methods. 1 Reference: Three people in Kansas have died from a listeria outbreak.

Resources and Evaluation,ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations,"In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary. Despite these varied range of possible text alterations, current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation, such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed.","ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary.

However, unlike prior works that assign the same length of codes to all words, we adaptively assign different lengths of codes to each word by learning downstream tasks. The proposed method works in two steps. First, each word directly learns to select its code length in an end-to-end manner by applying the Gumbel-softmax tricks. After selecting the code length, each word learns discrete codes through a neural network with a binary constraint. To showcase the general applicability of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance on four different downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly show that our method is effective and makes the highly compressed word embeddings without hurting the task accuracy.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",LogicalFactChecker: Leveraging Logical Operations for Fact Checking with Graph Module Network,"Verifying the correctness of a textual statement requires not only semantic reasoning about the meaning of words, but also symbolic reasoning about logical operations like count, superlative, aggregation, etc. In this work, we propose LogicalFactChecker, a neural network approach capable of leveraging logical operations for fact checking. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on TABFACT, a large-scale, benchmark dataset built for verifying a textual statement with semi-structured tables. This is achieved by a graph module network built upon the Transformer-based architecture. With a textual statement and a table as the input, LogicalFactChecker automatically derives a program (a.k.a. logical form) of the statement in a semantic parsing manner. A heterogeneous graph is then constructed to capture not only the structures of the table and the program, but also the connections between inputs with different modalities. Such a graph reveals the related contexts of each word in the statement, the table and the program. The graph is used to obtain graphenhanced contextual representations of words in Transformer-based architecture. After that, a program-driven module network is further introduced to exploit the hierarchical structure of the program, where semantic compositionality is dynamically modeled along the program structure with a set of function-specific modules. Ablation experiments suggest that both the heterogeneous graph and the module network are important to obtain strong results.","LogicalFactChecker: Leveraging Logical Operations for Fact Checking with Graph Module Network Verifying the correctness of a textual statement requires not only semantic reasoning about the meaning of words, but also symbolic reasoning about logical operations like count, superlative, aggregation, etc. In this work, we propose LogicalFactChecker, a neural network approach capable of leveraging logical operations for fact checking.

These improvements are due to expressive input representations, which, at least at the surface, are orthogonal to knowledge-rich constrained decoding mechanisms that helped linear SRL models.

The only requirement is that there are some shared parameters in the top layers of the multi-lingual encoder. To better understand this result, we also show that representations from monolingual BERT models in different languages can be aligned post-hoc quite effectively, strongly suggesting that, much like for non-contextual word embeddings, there are universal latent symmetries in the learned embedding spaces.

In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating whether neural models can learn systematicity of monotonicity inference in natural language, namely, the regularity for performing arbitrary inferences with generalization on composition. We consider four aspects of monotonicity inferences and test whether the models can systematically interpret lexical and logical phenomena on different training/test splits. A series of experiments show that three neural models systematically draw inferences on unseen combinations of lexical and logical phenomena when the syntactic structures of the sentences are similar between the training and test sets. However, the performance of the models significantly decreases when the structures are slightly changed in the test set while retaining all vocabularies and constituents already appearing in the training set. This indicates that the generalization ability of neural models is limited to cases where the syntactic structures are nearly the same as those in the training set. (1) P : Some [puppies ↑] ran.

The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. (...)

Six of them took place after 1990 and spilled a total of nearly 13,700 barrels. (...) We interviewed three scientists who said that the impact of a spill has little to do with its volume. Scientists have proven that spills far smaller than Santa Barbara's have been devastating.

First of all, two of the largest blowouts in the world took place in the U. S. the following year.

"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",Towards Robustifying NLI Models Against Lexical Dataset Biases,"While deep learning models are making fast progress on the task of Natural Language Inference, recent studies have also shown that these models achieve high accuracy by exploiting several dataset biases, and without deep understanding of the language semantics. Using contradiction-word bias and word-overlapping bias as our two bias examples, this paper explores both data-level and model-level debiasing methods to robustify models against lexical dataset biases. First, we debias the dataset through data augmentation and enhancement, but show that the model bias cannot be fully removed via this method. Next, we also compare two ways of directly debiasing the model without knowing what the dataset biases are in advance. The first approach aims to remove the label bias at the embedding level. The second approach employs a bag-of-words submodel to capture the features that are likely to exploit the bias and prevents the original model from learning these biased features by forcing orthogonality between these two submodels. We performed evaluations on new balanced datasets extracted from the original MNLI dataset as well as the NLI stress tests, and show that the orthogonality approach is better at debiasing the model while maintaining competitive overall accuracy. 1","Towards Robustifying NLI Models Against Lexical Dataset Biases While deep learning models are making fast progress on the task of Natural Language Inference, recent studies have also shown that these models achieve high accuracy by exploiting several dataset biases, and without deep understanding of the language semantics.

Such generated natural language (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they should correlate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, we focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the following question: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy, while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We propose Naturallanguage Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLI method which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to produce labels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectiveness over previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of the produced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports the claim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of their decisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanations in terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations. We argue that explicit evaluation of faithfulness, in addition to label and explanation accuracy, is an important step in evaluating model's explanations. Further, we demonstrate that task-specific probes are necessary to establish such sensitivity.","NILE : Natural Language Inference with Faithful Natural Language Explanations The recent growth in the popularity and success of deep learning models on NLP classification tasks has accompanied the need for generating some form of natural language explanation of the predicted labels.

This seemingly inevitable trade-off may not tell us much about the changes in the reasoning and understanding capabilities of the resulting models on broader types of examples beyond the small subset represented in the outof-distribution data. In this paper, we address this trade-off by introducing a novel debiasing method, called confidence regularization, which discourage models from exploiting biases while enabling them to receive enough incentive to learn from all the training examples. We evaluate our method on three NLU tasks and show that, in contrast to its predecessors, it improves the performance on out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., 7pp gain on HANS dataset) while maintaining the original in-distribution accuracy. 1","Mind the Trade-off: Debiasing NLU Models without Degrading the In-distribution Performance Models for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks often rely on the idiosyncratic biases of the dataset, which make them brittle against test cases outside the training distribution.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",SpanMlt: A Span-based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction,"Aspect terms extraction and opinion terms extraction are two key problems of fine-grained Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The aspect-opinion pairs can provide a global profile about a product or service for consumers and opinion mining systems. However, traditional methods can not directly output aspect-opinion pairs without given aspect terms or opinion terms. Although some recent co-extraction methods have been proposed to extract both terms jointly, they fail to extract them as pairs. To this end, this paper proposes an end-to-end method to solve the task of Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction (PAOTE). Furthermore, this paper treats the problem from a perspective of joint term and relation extraction rather than under the sequence tagging formulation performed in most prior works. We propose a multi-task learning framework based on shared spans, where the terms are extracted under the supervision of span boundaries.

Extensive experiments show that our model consistently outperforms stateof-the-art methods.","SpanMlt: A Span-based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction Aspect terms extraction and opinion terms extraction are two key problems of fine-grained Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The aspect-opinion pairs can provide a global profile about a product or service for consumers and opinion mining systems. However, traditional methods can not directly output aspect-opinion pairs without given aspect terms or opinion terms. Although some recent co-extraction methods have been proposed to extract both terms jointly, they fail to extract them as pairs. To this end, this paper proposes an end-to-end method to solve the task of Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction (PAOTE). Furthermore, this paper treats the problem from a perspective of joint term and relation extraction rather than under the sequence tagging formulation performed in most prior works. We propose a multi-task learning framework based on shared spans, where the terms are extracted under the supervision of span boundaries. Meanwhile, the pair-wise relations are jointly identified using the span representations. Extensive experiments show that our model consistently outperforms stateof-the-art methods.","spanmlt : span - base multi - task learning framework pair - wise aspect opinion term extraction aspect term extraction opinion term extraction key problem fine - grained aspect based sentiment analysis ( absa ) . aspect - opinion pair provide global profile product service consumer opinion mining system . , traditional method directly output aspect - opinion pair give aspect term opinion term . recent co - extraction method propose extract term jointly , fail extract pair . end , paper propose end - - end method solve task pair - wise aspect opinion terms extraction ( paote ) . furthermore , paper treat problem perspective joint term relation extraction sequence tagging formulation perform prior work . propose multi - task learning framework base share span , term extract supervision span boundary . , pair - wise relation jointly identify span representation . extensive experiment model consistently outperform stateof - - art method .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 0, 'Information Extraction': 8, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 6, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 1, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 3, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 22, 'Speech and Multimodality': 3, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 1, 'Theme': 2, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}","Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",True

With the shift from traditional news outlets to social media and similar venues, a major concern is that readers are becoming encapsulated in ""echo chambers"" and may fall prey to fake news and disinformation, lacking easy access to dissenting views. We suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns -that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments -and not just the stance -made in a given text. We study this problem in the context of debate speeches. Given such a speech, we aim to identify, from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance, the ones that directly counter it. We provide a large dataset of 3685 such speeches (in English), annotated for this relation, which hopefully would be of general interest to the NLP community.

It aims at extracting the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. To solve this task, the existing research employed a two-step framework, which first extracts individual emotion set and cause set, and then pair the corresponding emotions and causes. However, such a pipeline of two steps contains some inherent flaws: 1) the modeling does not aim at extracting the final emotion-cause pair directly; 2) the errors from the first step will affect the performance of the second step. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a new end-toend approach, called ECPE-Two-Dimensional (ECPE-2D), to represent the emotion-cause pairs by a 2D representation scheme. A 2D transformer module and two variants, windowconstrained and cross-road 2D transformers, are further proposed to model the interactions of different emotion-cause pairs.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Modelling Context and Syntactical Features for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) consists of two conceptual tasks, namely an aspect extraction and an aspect sentiment classification. Rather than considering the tasks separately, we build an end-to-end ABSA solution. Previous works in ABSA tasks did not fully leverage the importance of syntactical information. Hence, the aspect extraction model often failed to detect the boundaries of multi-word aspect terms. On the other hand, the aspect sentiment classifier was unable to account for the syntactical correlation between aspect terms and the context words. This paper explores the grammatical aspect of the sentence and employs the self-attention mechanism for syntactical learning. We combine part-of-speech embeddings, dependencybased embeddings and contextualized embeddings (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to enhance the performance of the aspect extractor. We also propose the syntactic relative distance to de-emphasize the adverse effects of unrelated words, having weak syntactic connection with the aspect terms.

Existing stance detection methods predict the polarity of a post's stance toward a topic or post, but don't consider the stance's degree of intensity. We introduce a new research problem, stance polarity and intensity prediction in response relationships between posts. This problem is challenging because differences in stance intensity are often subtle and require nuanced language understanding. Cyber argumentation research has shown that incorporating both stance polarity and intensity data in online debates leads to better discussion analysis. We explore five different learning models: Ridge-M regression, Ridge-S regression, SVR-RF-R, pkudblab-PIP, and T-PAN-PIP for predicting stance polarity and intensity in argumentation. These models are evaluated using a new dataset for stance polarity and intensity prediction collected using a cyber argumentation platform. The SVR-RF-R model performs best for prediction of stance polarity with an accuracy of 70.43% and intensity with RMSE of 0.596. This work is the first to train models for predicting a post's stance polarity and intensity in one combined value in cyber argumentation with reasonably good accuracy.","Agreement Prediction of Arguments in Cyber Argumentation for Detecting Stance Polarity and Intensity In online debates, users express different levels of agreement/disagreement with one another's arguments and ideas. Often levels of agreement/disagreement are implicit in the text and must be predicted to analyze collective opinions. Existing stance detection methods predict the polarity of a post's stance toward a topic or post, but don't consider the stance's degree of intensity.

With the help of automatically-mined knowledge, SKEP conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives, so as to embed sentiment information at the word, polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. In particular, the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification, aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair.

Experimental results show that our approach achieves the best performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 6.71% (p < 0.01) in F 1 measure.","transition - base directed graph construction emotion - cause pair extraction emotion - cause pair extraction aim extract potential pair emotion corresponding cause unannotated emotion text . exist method pipelined framework , identify emotion extract cause separately , lead drawback error propagation . issue , propose transition - base model transform task procedure parsing - like direct graph construction . propose model incrementally generate direct graph label edge base sequence action , recognize emotion corresponding cause simultaneously , optimize separate subtask jointly maximize mutual benefit task interdependently . experimental result approach achieve good performance , outperform state - - - art method 6.71 % ( p < 0.01 ) f 1 measure .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 1, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 5, 'Information Extraction': 3, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 3, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 0, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 3, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 4, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 13, 'Speech and Multimodality': 7, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 2, 'System Demonstrations': 0, 'Theme': 0, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}","Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",True
"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation,"In argumentation, people state premises to reason towards a conclusion. The conclusion conveys a stance towards some target, such as a concept or statement. Often, the conclusion remains implicit, though, since it is self-evident in a discussion or left out for rhetorical reasons. However, the conclusion is key to understanding an argument, and hence, to any application that processes argumentation. We thus study the question to what extent an argument's conclusion can be reconstructed from its premises. In particular, we argue here that a decisive step is to infer a conclusion's target, and we hypothesize that this target is related to the premises' targets. We develop two complementary target inference approaches: one ranks premise targets and selects the top-ranked target as the conclusion target, the other finds a new conclusion target in a learned embedding space using a triplet neural network. Our evaluation on corpora from two domains indicates that a hybrid of both approaches is best, outperforming several strong baselines. According to human annotators, we infer a reasonably adequate conclusion target in 89% of the cases.","Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation In argumentation, people state premises to reason towards a conclusion.

Remarkable success has been achieved when sufficient labeled training data is available.

In this paper, we proposed a Semantic-Emotion Knowledge Transferring (SEKT) model for cross-target stance detection, which uses the external knowledge (semantic and emotion lexicons) as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer across different targets. Specifically, a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons, which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. Then, the learned semantic-emotion graph representation, which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains, is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledgeaware memory unit to the BiLSTM cell. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of SEKT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.","Enhancing Cross-target Stance Detection with Transferable Semantic-Emotion Knowledge Stance detection is an important task, which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target.

"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining",Modeling Label Semantics for Predicting Emotional Reactions,"Predicting how events induce emotions in the characters of a story is typically seen as a standard multi-label classification task, which usually treats labels as anonymous classes to predict. They ignore information that may be conveyed by the emotion labels themselves. We propose that the semantics of emotion labels can guide a model's attention when representing the input story. Further, we observe that the emotions evoked by an event are often related: an event that evokes joy is unlikely to also evoke sadness. In this work, we explicitly model label classes via label embeddings, and add mechanisms that track label-label correlations both during training and inference. We also introduce a new semi-supervision strategy that regularizes for the correlations on unlabeled data. Our empirical evaluations show that modeling label semantics yields consistent benefits, and we advance the state-of-theart on an emotion inference task.","Modeling Label Semantics for Predicting Emotional Reactions Predicting how events induce emotions in the characters of a story is typically seen as a standard multi-label classification task, which usually treats labels as anonymous classes to predict.

Speech and Multimodality,"Sentiment and Emotion help Sarcasm? A Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis","In this paper, we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion, and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario. We, at first, manually annotate the recently released multi-modal MUStARD sarcasm dataset with sentiment and emotion classes, both implicit and explicit. For multitasking, we propose two attention mechanisms, viz. Inter-segment Inter-modal Attention (I e -Attention) and Intra-segment Inter-modal Attention (I a -Attention). The main motivation of I e -Attention is to learn the relationship between the different segments of the sentence across the modalities. In contrast, I a -Attention focuses within the same segment of the sentence across the modalities. Finally, representations from both the attentions are concatenated and shared across the five classes (i.e., sarcasm, implicit sentiment, explicit sentiment, implicit emotion, explicit emotion) for multi-tasking. Experimental results on the extended version of the MUStARD dataset show the efficacy of our proposed approach for sarcasm detection over the existing state-of-theart systems. The evaluation also shows that the proposed multi-task framework yields better performance for the primary task, i.e., sarcasm detection, with the help of two secondary tasks, emotion and sentiment analysis.","Sentiment and Emotion help Sarcasm?

Speech and Multimodality,Towards Emotion-aided Multi-modal Dialogue Act Classification,"The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively. But these studies limit themselves to text. Non-verbal features (change of tone, facial expressions etc.) can provide cues to identify DAs, thus stressing the benefit of incorporating multi-modal inputs in the task. Also, the emotional state of the speaker has a substantial effect on the choice of the dialogue act, since conversations are often influenced by emotions. Hence, the effect of emotion too on automatic identification of DAs needs to be studied. In this work, we address the role of both multi-modality and emotion recognition (ER) in DAC. DAC and ER help each other by way of multi-task learning. One of the major contributions of this work is a new dataset-multimodal Emotion aware Dialogue Act dataset called EMOTyDA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. To demonstrate the utility of EMOTyDA, we build an attention based (self, inter-modal, inter-task) multi-modal, multi-task Deep Neural Network (DNN) for joint learning of DAs and emotions. We show empirically that multimodality and multi-tasking achieve better performance of DAC compared to uni-modal and single task DAC variants. amounting to a total of 13708 utterances across the dataset. Each utterance is annotated for the presence of 7 emotions namely sadness, anger, fear, joy, surprise, disgust, and neutral.","Towards Emotion-aided Multi-modal Dialogue Act Classification The task of Dialogue Act Classification (DAC) that purports to capture communicative intent has been studied extensively.

To better understand human perception of deception, we created a game framework, LieCatcher, to collect ratings of perceived deception using a large corpus of deceptive and truthful interviews. We analyzed the acoustic-prosodic and linguistic characteristics of language trusted and mistrusted by raters and compared these to characteristics of actual truthful and deceptive language to understand how perception aligns with reality. With this data we built classifiers to automatically distinguish trusted from mistrusted speech, achieving an F1 of 66.1%. We next evaluated whether the strategies raters said they used to discriminate between truthful and deceptive responses were in fact useful. Our results show that, although several prosodic and lexical features were consistently perceived as trustworthy, they were not reliable cues. Also, the strategies that judges reported using in deception detection were not helpful for the task.

One example is Autoregressive Predictive Coding (Chung et al., 2019) , which trains an autoregressive RNN to generate an unseen future frame given a context such as recent past frames. The basic hypothesis of these approaches is that hidden states that can accurately predict future frames are a useful representation for many downstream tasks. In this paper we extend this hypothesis and aim to enrich the information encoded in the hidden states by training the model to make more accurate future predictions. We propose an auxiliary objective that serves as a regularization to improve generalization of the future frame prediction task. Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content.","Improved Speech Representations with Multi-Target Autoregressive Predictive Coding Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech.

Speech and Multimodality,Phone Features Improve Speech Translation,"End-to-end models for speech translation (ST) more tightly couple speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) than a traditional cascade of separate ASR and MT models, with simpler model architectures and the potential for reduced error propagation. Their performance is often assumed to be superior, though in many conditions this is not yet the case. We compare cascaded and end-to-end models across high, medium, and low-resource conditions, and show that cascades remain stronger baselines. Further, we introduce two methods to incorporate phone features into ST models. We show that these features improve both architectures, closing the gap between end-to-end models and cascades, and outperforming previous academic work -by up to 9 BLEU on our low-resource setting.","Phone Features Improve Speech Translation End-to-end models for speech translation (ST) more tightly couple speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) than a traditional cascade of separate ASR and MT models, with simpler model architectures and the potential for reduced error propagation.

Existing automatic metrics do not capture such mistakes effectively. We tackle the problem of evaluating faithfulness of a generated summary given its source document.

We find that current models exhibit a trade-off between abstractiveness and faithfulness: outputs with less word overlap with the source document are more likely to be unfaithful. Next, we propose an automatic question answering (QA) based metric for faithfulness, FEQA, 1 which leverages recent advances in reading comprehension. Given questionanswer pairs generated from the summary, a QA model extracts answers from the document; non-matched answers indicate unfaithful information in the summary. Among metrics based on word overlap, embedding similarity, and learned language understanding models, our QA-based metric has significantly higher correlation with human faithfulness scores, especially on highly abstractive summaries.","FEQA: A Question Answering Evaluation Framework for Faithfulness Assessment in Abstractive Summarization Neural abstractive summarization models are prone to generate content inconsistent with the source document, i.e. unfaithful.

We argue that, to address these issues, the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, e.g., via structured representation, to allow the generation of more informative summaries. In this paper, we present ASGARD, a novel framework for Abstractive Summarization with Graph-Augmentation and semantic-driven RewarD. We propose the use of dual encoders-a sequential document encoder and a graphstructured encoder-to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities, complementing each other. We further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. Results show that our models produce significantly higher ROUGE scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both New York Times and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. We also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are finetuned from large pretrained language models.

Summarization,Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization,"Recently BERT has been adopted for document encoding in state-of-the-art text summarization models. However, sentence-based extractive models often result in redundant or uninformative phrases in the extracted summaries. Also, long-range dependencies throughout a document are not well captured by BERT, which is pre-trained on sentence pairs instead of documents. To address these issues, we present a discourse-aware neural summarization model -DISCOBERT 1 . DISCOBERT extracts sub-sentential discourse units (instead of sentences) as candidates for extractive selection on a finer granularity. To capture the long-range dependencies among discourse units, structural discourse graphs are constructed based on RST trees and coreference mentions, encoded with Graph Convolutional Networks. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on popular summarization benchmarks compared to other BERT-base models.","Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization Recently BERT has been adopted for document encoding in state-of-the-art text summarization models.

Summarization,Screenplay Summarization Using Latent Narrative Structure,"Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront. As a result, such models are biased by position and often perform a smart selection of sentences from the beginning of the document. When summarizing long narratives, which have complex structure and present information piecemeal, simple position heuristics are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose to explicitly incorporate the underlying structure of narratives into general unsupervised and supervised extractive summarization models. We formalize narrative structure in terms of key narrative events (turning points) and treat it as latent in order to summarize screenplays (i.e., extract an optimal sequence of scenes). Experimental results on the CSI corpus of TV screenplays, which we augment with scene-level summarization labels, show that latent turning points correlate with important aspects of a CSI episode and improve summarization performance over general extractive algorithms, leading to more complete and diverse summaries.","Screenplay Summarization Using Latent Narrative Structure Most general-purpose extractive summarization models are trained on news articles, which are short and present all important information upfront.

Summarization,Self-Attention Guided Copy Mechanism for Abstractive Summarization,"Copy module has been widely equipped in the recent abstractive summarization models, which facilitates the decoder to extract words from the source into the summary. Generally, the encoder-decoder attention is served as the copy distribution, while how to guarantee that important words in the source are copied remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based model to enhance the copy mechanism. Specifically, we identify the importance of each source word based on the degree centrality with a directed graph built by the self-attention layer in the Transformer. We use the centrality of each source word to guide the copy process explicitly. Experimental results show that the self-attention graph provides useful guidance for the copy distribution. Our proposed models significantly outperform the baseline methods on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and the Gigaword dataset.","Self-Attention Guided Copy Mechanism for Abstractive Summarization Copy module has been widely equipped in the recent abstractive summarization models, which facilitates the decoder to extract words from the source into the summary.

Summarization,Improving Truthfulness of Headline Generation,"Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries. However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of generated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in the source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline generation on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the stateof-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes generates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in untruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify the truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment of whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing untruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the untruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out untruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results demonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision data shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in automatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines.","Improving Truthfulness of Headline Generation Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system and reference summaries.

Summarization,Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual Consistency of Summaries,"Practical applications of abstractive summarization models are limited by frequent factual inconsistencies with respect to their input. Existing automatic evaluation metrics for summarization are largely insensitive to such errors. We propose QAGS, 1 an automatic evaluation protocol that is designed to identify factual inconsistencies in a generated summary. QAGS is based on the intuition that if we ask questions about a summary and its source, we will receive similar answers if the summary is factually consistent with the source. To evaluate QAGS, we collect human judgments of factual consistency on model-generated summaries for the CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) summarization datasets. QAGS has substantially higher correlations with these judgments than other automatic evaluation metrics. Also, QAGS offers a natural form of interpretability: The answers and questions generated while computing QAGS indicate which tokens of a summary are inconsistent and why.

Summarization,Unsupervised Opinion Summarization as Copycat-Review Generation,"Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews. While the majority of previous work has focused on the extractive setting, i.e., selecting fragments from input reviews to produce a summary, we let the model generate novel sentences and hence produce abstractive summaries. Recent progress in summarization has seen the development of supervised models which rely on large quantities of document-summary pairs. Since such training data is expensive to acquire, we instead consider the unsupervised setting, in other words, we do not use any summaries in training. We define a generative model for a review collection which capitalizes on the intuition that when generating a new review given a set of other reviews of a product, we should be able to control the ""amount of novelty"" going into the new review or, equivalently, vary the extent to which it deviates from the input. At test time, when generating summaries, we force the novelty to be minimal, and produce a text reflecting consensus opinions. We capture this intuition by defining a hierarchical variational autoencoder model. Both individual reviews and the products they correspond to are associated with stochastic latent codes, and the review generator (""decoder"") has direct access to the text of input reviews through the pointergenerator mechanism. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp datasets, show that setting at test time the review's latent code to its mean, allows the model to produce fluent and coherent summaries reflecting common opinions.","Unsupervised Opinion Summarization as Copycat-Review Generation Opinion summarization is the task of automatically creating summaries that reflect subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as product reviews.

One big challenge for addressing this task is the lack of training data. Usually, explicit citation texts are easy to extract, but it is not easy to extract implicit citation texts from scholarly papers. We thus first train an implicit citation text extraction model based on BERT and leverage the model to construct a large training dataset for the citation text generation task.

"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing",Efficient Second-Order TreeCRF for Neural Dependency Parsing,"In the deep learning (DL) era, parsing models are extremely simplified with little hurt on performance, thanks to the remarkable capability of multi-layer BiLSTMs in context representation. As the most popular graphbased dependency parser due to its high efficiency and performance, the biaffine parser directly scores single dependencies under the arc-factorization assumption, and adopts a very simple local token-wise cross-entropy training loss. This paper for the first time presents a second-order TreeCRF extension to the biaffine parser. For a long time, the complexity and inefficiency of the inside-outside algorithm hinder the popularity of TreeCRF. To address this issue, we propose an effective way to batchify the inside and Viterbi algorithms for direct large matrix operation on GPUs, and to avoid the complex outside algorithm via efficient back-propagation. Experiments and analysis on 27 datasets from 13 languages clearly show that techniques developed before the DL era, such as structural learning (global TreeCRF loss) and high-order modeling are still useful, and can further boost parsing performance over the state-of-the-art biaffine parser, especially for partially annotated training data.

To explore whether syntactic probes would do better to make use of existing techniques, we compare the structural probe to a more traditional parser with an identical lightweight parameterisation.

This paradigm consists of three stages: (1) pretraining of a word prediction model on a corpus of arbitrary size; (2) fine-tuning (transfer learning) on a training set representing a classification task; (3) evaluation on a test set drawn from the same distribution as that training set. This paradigm favors simple, low-bias architectures, which, first, can be scaled to process vast amounts of data, and second, can capture the fine-grained statistical properties of a particular data set, regardless of whether those properties are likely to generalize to examples of the task outside the data set. This contrasts with humans, who learn language from several orders of magnitude less data than the systems favored by this evaluation paradigm, and generalize to new tasks in a consistent way. We advocate for supplementing or replacing PAID with paradigms that reward architectures that generalize as quickly and robustly as humans.","How Can We Accelerate Progress Towards Human-like Linguistic Generalization?

System Demonstrations,CLIReval: Evaluating Machine Translation as a Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval Task,"We present CLIReval, an easy-to-use toolkit for evaluating machine translation (MT) with the proxy task of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). Contrary to what the project name might suggest, CLIReval does not actually require any annotated CLIR dataset. Instead, it automatically transforms translations and references used in MT evaluations into a synthetic CLIR dataset; it then sets up a standard search engine (Elasticsearch) and computes various information retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) by treating the translations as documents to be retrieved.

Contrary to what the project name might suggest, CLIReval does not actually require any annotated CLIR dataset. Instead, it automatically transforms translations and references used in MT evaluations into a synthetic CLIR dataset; it then sets up a standard search engine (Elasticsearch) and computes various information retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) by treating the translations as documents to be retrieved.

System Demonstrations,OpusFilter: A Configurable Parallel Corpus Filtering Toolbox,"This paper introduces OpusFilter, a flexible and modular toolbox for filtering parallel corpora. It implements a number of components based on heuristic filters, language identification libraries, character-based language models, and word alignment tools, and it can easily be extended with custom filters. Bitext segments can be ranked according to their quality or domain match using single features or a logistic regression model that can be trained without manually labeled training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OpusFilter on the example of a Finnish-English news translation task based on noisy web-crawled training data. Applying our tool leads to improved translation quality while significantly reducing the size of the training data, also clearly outperforming an alternative ranking given in the crawled data set. Furthermore, we show the ability of OpusFilter to perform data selection for domain adaptation.","OpusFilter: A Configurable Parallel Corpus Filtering Toolbox This paper introduces OpusFilter, a flexible and modular toolbox for filtering parallel corpora.

Specifically, our work integrates retrieval based semantic parsing predicates into the branching story structures well known to the Interactive Fiction community, relaxing the relatively strict lexical options of preexisting systems.","usnea : authorship tool interactive fiction retrieval base semantic parsing reader choose adventure novel user modern virtual assistant subtle similarity ; , right lens , view engage work interactive fiction . literary form emerge 1970 grow like vine branch modern technology , guide advance . work weave thread interactive fiction community neural semantic parsing dialog system , define datum model necessary algorithm novel type interactive fiction open source accompany authoring tool . specifically , work integrate retrieval base semantic parsing predicate branch story structure known interactive fiction community , relax relatively strict lexical option preexist system .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 1, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 3, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 1, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 2, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 2, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 1, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 1, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 9, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 3, 'System Demonstrations': 11, 'Theme': 0, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",System Demonstrations,True
System Demonstrations,"MMPE: A Multi-Modal Interface using Handwriting, Touch Reordering, and Speech Commands for Post-Editing Machine Translation","The shift from traditional translation to postediting (PE) of machine-translated (MT) text can save time and reduce errors, but it also affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard, we present MMPE, the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen, touch, and speech modalities for PE of MT. Users can directly cross out or hand-write new text, drag and drop words for reordering, or use spoken commands to update the text in place. All text manipulations are logged in an easily interpretable format to simplify subsequent translation process research. The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions. Overall, experiment participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as useful extensions to mouse & keyboard, but not as a complete substitute.","MMPE: A Multi-Modal Interface using Handwriting, Touch Reordering, and Speech Commands for Post-Editing Machine Translation The shift from traditional translation to postediting (PE) of machine-translated (MT) text can save time and reduce errors, but it also affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals.

System Demonstrations,Conversation Learner - A Machine Teaching Tool for Building Dialog Managers for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems,"Traditionally, industry solutions for building a task-oriented dialog system have relied on helping dialog authors define rule-based dialog managers, represented as dialog flows. While dialog flows are intuitively interpretable and good for simple scenarios, they fall short of performance in terms of the flexibility needed to handle complex dialogs. On the other hand, purely machine-learned models can handle complex dialogs, but they are considered to be black boxes and require large amounts of training data. In this demonstration, we showcase Conversation Learner, a machine teaching tool for building dialog managers. It combines the best of both approaches by enabling dialog authors to create a dialog flow using familiar tools, converting the dialog flow into a parametric model (e.g., neural networks), and allowing dialog authors to improve the dialog manager (i.e., the parametric model) over time by leveraging user-system dialog logs as training data through a machine teaching interface.","Conversation Learner - A Machine Teaching Tool for Building Dialog Managers for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems Traditionally, industry solutions for building a task-oriented dialog system have relied on helping dialog authors define rule-based dialog managers, represented as dialog flows.

System Demonstrations,Label Noise in Context,"Label noise-incorrectly or ambiguously labeled training examples-can negatively impact model performance. Although noise detection techniques have been around for decades, practitioners rarely apply them, as manual noise remediation is a tedious process. Examples incorrectly flagged as noise waste reviewers' time, and correcting label noise without guidance can be difficult. We propose LNIC, a noise-detection method that uses an example's neighborhood within the training set to (a) reduce false positives and (b) provide an explanation as to why the example was flagged as noise. We demonstrate on several short-text classification datasets that LNIC outperforms the state of the art on measures of precision and F 0.5 -score. We also show how LNIC's training set context helps a reviewer to understand and correct label noise in a dataset. The LNIC tool lowers the barriers to label noise remediation, increasing its utility for NLP practitioners.","Label Noise in Context Label noise-incorrectly or ambiguously labeled training examples-can negatively impact model performance.

Although CodaLab has gained popularity in the research community, its interface has limited support for creating reusable tools that can be easily applied to new datasets and composed into pipelines. In clinical domain, natural language processing (NLP) on medical notes generally involves multiple steps, like tokenization, named entity recognition, etc. Since these steps require different tools which are usually scattered in different publications, it is not easy for researchers to use them to process their own datasets. In this paper, we present BENTO, a workflow management platform with a graphic user interface (GUI) that is built on top of CodaLab, to facilitate the process of building clinical NLP pipelines. BENTO comes with a number of clinical NLP tools that have been pre-trained using medical notes and expert annotations and can be readily used for various clinical NLP tasks. It also allows researchers and developers to create their custom tools (e.g., pretrained NLP models) and use them in a controlled and reproducible way. In addition, the GUI interface enables researchers with limited computer background to compose tools into NLP pipelines and then apply the pipelines on their own datasets in a ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG) way.

Nen verbal morphology is particularly complex, with a transitive verb taking up to 1, 740 unique features. The structural properties exhibited by Nen verbs raises interesting choices for analysis.

'Chunking' refers to the concept of collating morphological segments into one, whereas the decomposition model follows a more classical linguistic approach. Both models are built using the Finite-State Transducer toolkit foma. The resultant architecture shows differences in size and structural clarity. While the 'Chunking' model is under half the size of the full decomposed counterpart, the decomposition displays higher structural order.

As a result, these models may sufficiently account for discourse context of task-oriented but not social conversations. We conduct a pilot annotation study of NTUs as a first step towards a model capable of rationalizing conversational coherence in social talk. We start with the naturally occurring social dialogues in the Disco-SPICE corpus, annotated with discourse relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) and Cognitive approach to Coherence Relations (CCR) frameworks. We first annotate content-based coherence relations that are not available in Disco-SPICE, and then heuristically identify NTUs, which lack a coherence relation to prior discourse. Based on the interaction between NTUs and their discourse context, we construct a classification for NTUs that actually convey certain non-topical coherence in social talk. This classification introduces new sequence-based social intents that traditional taxonomies of speech acts do not capture.

Student Research Workshop,Crossing the Line: Where do Demographic Variables Fit into Humor Detection?,"Recent shared tasks in humor classification have struggled with two issues: scope and subjectivity. Regarding scope, many task datasets either comprise a highly constrained genre of humor which does not broadly represent the genre, or the data collection is so indiscriminate that the inter-annotator agreement on its comic content is drastically low. In terms of subjectivity, these tasks typically average over all annotators' judgments, in spite of the fact that humor is highly subjective and varies both between and within cultures. We propose a dataset which maintains a broad scope but which addresses subjectivity. We will collect demographic information about the data's humor annotators in order to bin ratings more sensibly. We also suggest the addition of an 'offensive' label to reflect the fact a text may be humorous to one group, but offensive to another.

We show that the system outperforms previous logic-based systems as well as recent deep learning-based models.","logical inference comparatives generalized quantifier comparative construction pose challenge natural language inference ( nli ) , task determine text entail hypothesis . comparative structurally complex interact linguistic phenomenon quantifier , numeral , lexical antonym . formal semantic , rich body work comparative gradable expression notion degree . , logical inference system comparative sufficiently develop use nli task . paper , present compositional semantics map comparative construction english semantic representation combinatory categorial grammar ( ccg ) parser combine inference system base automate theorem proving . evaluate system nli dataset contain complex logical inference comparative , generalize quantifier , numeral . system outperform previous logic - base system recent deep learning - base model .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 0, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 1, 'Information Extraction': 2, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 0, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 4, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 0, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 2, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 0, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 11, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 1, 'System Demonstrations': 5, 'Theme': 1, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 1}","Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas",False
Student Research Workshop,Research on Task Discovery for Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural network based machine learning models are shown to perform poorly on unseen or out-of-domain examples by numerous recent studies. Transfer learning aims to avoid overfitting and to improve generalizability by leveraging the information obtained from multiple tasks. Yet, the benefits of transfer learning depend largely on task selection and finding the right method of sharing. In this thesis, we hypothesize that current deep neural network based transfer learning models do not achieve their fullest potential for various tasks and there are still many task combinations that will benefit from transfer learning that are not considered by the current models. To this end, we started our research by implementing a novel multi-task learner with relaxed annotated data requirements and obtained a performance improvement on two NLP tasks. We will further devise models to tackle tasks from multiple areas of machine learning, such as Bioinformatics and Computer Vision, in addition to NLP.","Research on Task Discovery for Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks Deep neural network based machine learning models are shown to perform poorly on unseen or out-of-domain examples by numerous recent studies.

Student Research Workshop,Feature Difference Makes Sense: A medical image captioning model exploiting feature difference and tag information,"Medical image captioning can reduce the workload of physicians and save time and expense by automatically generating reports. However, current datasets are small and limited, creating additional challenges for researchers. In this study, we propose a feature difference and tag information combined long short-term memory (LSTM) model for chest x-ray report generation. A feature vector extracted from the image conveys visual information, but its ability to describe the image is limited. Other image captioning studies exhibited improved performance by exploiting feature differences, so the proposed model also utilizes them. First, we propose a difference and tag (DiTag) model containing the difference between the patient and normal images. Then, we propose a multi-difference and tag (mDiTag) model that also contains information about low-level differences, such as contrast, texture, and localized area.

Student Research Workshop,Preventing Critical Scoring Errors in Short Answer Scoring with Confidence Estimation,"Many recent Short Answer Scoring (SAS) systems have employed Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation measure of their systems.

We introduce a new task formulation of SAS that matches the actual usage. In our formulation, the SAS systems should extract as many scoring predictions that are not critical scoring errors (CSEs). We conduct the experiments in our new task formulation and demonstrate that a typical SAS system can predict scores with zero CSE for approximately 50% of test data at maximum by filtering out low-reliablility predictions on the basis of a certain confidence estimation. This result directly indicates the possibility of reducing half the scoring cost of human raters, which is more preferable for the evaluation of SAS systems.","Preventing Critical Scoring Errors in Short Answer Scoring with Confidence Estimation Many recent Short Answer Scoring (SAS) systems have employed Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation measure of their systems.

Student Research Workshop,Efficient Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages via Exploiting Related Languages,"A large percentage of the world's population speaks a language of the Indian subcontinent, comprising languages from both Indo-Aryan (e.g. Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, etc.) and Dravidian (e.g. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, etc.) families. A universal characteristic of Indian languages is their complex morphology, which, when combined with the general lack of sufficient quantities of high-quality parallel data, can make developing machine translation (MT) systems for these languages difficult. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a rapidly advancing MT paradigm and has shown promising results for many language pairs, especially in large training data scenarios. Since the condition of large parallel corpora is not met for Indian-English language pairs, we present our efforts towards building efficient NMT systems between Indian languages (specifically Indo-Aryan languages) and English via efficiently exploiting parallel data from the related languages. We propose a technique called Unified Transliteration and Subword Segmentation to leverage language similarity while exploiting parallel data from related language pairs. We also propose a Multilingual Transfer Learning technique to leverage parallel data from multiple related languages to assist translation for lowresource language pair of interest. Our experiments demonstrate an overall average improvement of 5 BLEU points over the standard Transformer-based NMT baselines.","Efficient Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages via Exploiting Related Languages A large percentage of the world's population speaks a language of the Indian subcontinent, comprising languages from both Indo-Aryan (e.g. Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, etc.) and Dravidian (e.g. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, etc.) families.

Student Research Workshop,Research Replication Prediction Using Weakly Supervised Learning,"Knowing whether a published research result can be replicated is important. Carrying out direct replication of published research incurs a high cost. There are efforts tried to use machine learning aided methods to predict scientific claims' replicability. However, existing machine learning aided approaches use only hand-extracted statistics features such as p-value, sample size, etc. without utilizing research papers' text information and train only on a very small size of annotated data without making the most use of a large number of unlabeled articles. Therefore, it is desirable to develop effective machine learning aided automatic methods which can automatically extract text information as features so that we can benefit from Natural Language Processing techniques. Besides, we aim for an approach that benefits from both labeled and the large number of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose two weakly supervised learning approaches that use automatically extracted text information of research papers to improve the prediction accuracy of research replication using both labeled and unlabeled datasets. Our experiments over real-world datasets show that our approaches obtain much better prediction performance compared to the supervised models utilizing only statistic features and a small size of labeled dataset.

Further, we are able to achieve an accuracy of 75.76% for predicting the replicability of research.","research replication prediction weakly supervise learn know publish research result replicate important . carry direct replication publish research incur high cost . effort try use machine learning aid method predict scientific claim ' replicability . , exist machine learning aid approach use hand - extract statistic feature p - value , sample size , etc . utilize research paper ' text information train small size annotate datum make use large number unlabeled article . , desirable develop effective machine learning aid automatic method automatically extract text information feature benefit natural language processing technique . , aim approach benefit label large number unlabeled datum . paper , propose weakly supervise learning approach use automatically extract text information research paper improve prediction accuracy research replication label unlabeled dataset . experiment real - world dataset approach obtain well prediction performance compare supervise model utilize statistic feature small size label dataset . , able achieve accuracy 75.76 % predict replicability research .","{'Computational Social Science and Social Media': 1, 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems': 0, 'Discourse and Pragmatics': 0, 'Ethics and NLP': 0, 'Generation': 3, 'Information Extraction': 0, 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining': 0, 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP': 3, 'Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond': 0, 'Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics': 0, 'Machine Learning for NLP': 5, 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality': 3, 'NLP Applications': 0, 'Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation': 4, 'Question Answering': 0, 'Resources and Evaluation': 7, 'Semantics: Lexical Semantics': 0, 'Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas': 0, 'Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining': 0, 'Speech and Multimodality': 0, 'Student Research Workshop': 0, 'Summarization': 0, 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing': 0, 'System Demonstrations': 7, 'Theme': 3, 'Theory and Formalism in NLP (Linguistic and Mathematical)': 0}",Resources and Evaluation,False
Student Research Workshop,How much complexity does an RNN architecture need to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies?,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and their variants are capable of encapsulating long-range dependencies, which is evident from their performance on a variety of linguistic tasks. On the other hand, simple recurrent networks (SRNs), which appear more biologically grounded in terms of synaptic connections, have generally been less successful at capturing long-range dependencies as well as the loci of grammatical errors in an unsupervised setting. In this paper, we seek to develop models that bridge the gap between biological plausibility and linguistic competence. We propose a new architecture, the Decay RNN, which incorporates the decaying nature of neuronal activations and models the excitatory and inhibitory connections in a population of neurons. Besides its biological inspiration, our model also shows competitive performance relative to LSTMs on subject-verb agreement, sentence grammaticality, and language modeling tasks. These results provide some pointers towards probing the nature of the inductive biases required for RNN architectures to model linguistic phenomena successfully.","How much complexity does an RNN architecture need to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies?

Student Research Workshop,Checkpoint Reranking: An Approach to Select Better Hypothesis for Neural Machine Translation Systems,"In this paper, we propose a method of reranking the outputs of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems. After the decoding process, we select a few last iteration outputs in the training process as the N -best list. After training a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) baseline system, it has been observed that these iteration outputs have an oracle score higher than baseline up to 1.01 BLEU points compared to the last iteration of the trained system.We come up with a ranking mechanism by solely focusing on the decoder's ability to generate distinct tokens and without the usage of any language model or data. With this method, we achieved a translation improvement up to +0.16 BLEU points over baseline.We also evaluate our approach by applying the coverage penalty to the training process.In cases of moderate coverage penalty, the oracle scores are higher than the final iteration up to +0.99 BLEU points, and our algorithm gives an improvement up to +0.17 BLEU points.With excessive penalty, there is a decrease in translation quality compared to the baseline system. Still, an increase in oracle scores up to +1.30 is observed with the re-ranking algorithm giving an improvement up to +0.15 BLEU points is found in case of excessive penalty.The proposed re-ranking method is a generic one and can be extended to other language pairs as well.","Checkpoint Reranking: An Approach to Select Better Hypothesis for Neural Machine Translation Systems In this paper, we propose a method of reranking the outputs of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems.

Student Research Workshop,Building a Japanese Typo Dataset from Wikipedia's Revision History,"User generated texts contain many typos for which correction is necessary for NLP systems to work. Although a large number of typo-correction pairs are needed to develop a data-driven typo correction system, no such dataset is available for Japanese. In this paper, we extract over half a million Japanese typo-correction pairs from Wikipedia's revision history. Unlike other languages, Japanese poses unique challenges: (1) Japanese texts are unsegmented so that we cannot simply apply a spelling checker, and (2) the way people inputting kanji logographs results in typos with drastically different surface forms from correct ones. We address them by combining character-based extraction rules, morphological analyzers to guess readings, and various filtering methods. We evaluate the dataset using crowdsourcing and run a baseline seq2seq model for typo correction.","Building a Japanese Typo Dataset from Wikipedia's Revision History User generated texts contain many typos for which correction is necessary for NLP systems to work.

Student Research Workshop,A Simple and Effective Dependency Parser for Telugu,"We present a simple and effective dependency parser for Telugu, a morphologically rich, free word order language. We propose to replace the rich linguistic feature templates used in the past approaches with a minimal feature function using contextual vector representations. We train a BERT model on the Telugu Wikipedia data and use vector representations from this model to train the parser. Each sentence token is associated with a vector representing the token in the context of that sentence and the feature vectors are constructed by concatenating two token representations from the stack and one from the buffer. We put the feature representations through a feed forward network and train with a greedy transition based approach. The resulting parser has a very simple architecture with minimal feature engineering and achieves state-of-the-art results for Telugu.","A Simple and Effective Dependency Parser for Telugu We present a simple and effective dependency parser for Telugu, a morphologically rich, free word order language.

Student Research Workshop,Inducing Grammar from Long Short-Term Memory Networks by Shapley Decomposition,"The principle of compositionality has deep roots in linguistics: the meaning of an expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents. However, modern neural network models such as long shortterm memory network process expressions in a linear fashion and do not seem to incorporate more complex compositional patterns. In this work, we show that we can explicitly induce grammar by tracing the computational process of a long short-term memory network. We show: (i) the multiplicative nature of long short-term memory network allows complex interaction beyond sequential linear combination; (ii) we can generate compositional trees from the network without external linguistic knowledge; (iii) we evaluate the syntactic difference between the generated trees, randomly generated trees and gold reference trees produced by constituency parsers; (iv) we evaluate whether the generated trees contain the rich semantic information. 1","Inducing Grammar from Long Short-Term Memory Networks by Shapley Decomposition The principle of compositionality has deep roots in linguistics: the meaning of an expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents.
